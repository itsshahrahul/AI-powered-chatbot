The primary target audience is upper-division \\nundergraduates in a management information systems (MIS) or computer informa-\\ntion systems curriculum; a secondary target audience is MIS majors in MBA and MS \\nprograms. Although not explicitly written for the junior college and professional \\n development markets, this book can also be used by these programs.\\nWe have over 55 years of combined teaching experience in systems analysis and \\ndesign and have used that experience to create this newest edition of Modern Systems \\nAnalysis and Design. We provide a clear presentation of the concepts, skills, and tech-\\nniques that students need to become effective systems analysts who work with others \\nto create information systems for businesses. We use the systems development life \\ncycle (SDLC) model as an organizing tool throughout the book to provide students \\nwith a strong conceptual and systematic framework. The SDLC in this edition has five \\nphases and a circular design.\\nWith this text, we assume that students have taken an introductory course on \\ncomputer systems and have experience designing programs in at least one program-\\nming language. We review basic system principles for those students who have not \\nbeen exposed to the material on which systems development methods are based. We \\nalso assume that students have a solid background in computing literacy and a gener-\\nal understanding of the core elements of a business, including basic terms associated \\nwith the production, marketing, finance, and accounting functions.\\nnew tO the eighth eDitiOn\\nThe following features are new to the Eighth Edition:\\n•\\t New material. To keep up with the changing environment for systems develop-\\nment, Chapter 12 has undergone a complete and thorough revision. While \\ncloud computing is introduced in Chapter 2, it is given extensive coverage in \\nthe revised Chapter 12. Service-oriented architecture has been reintroduced \\nto the book in the version of Chapter 12. Other new material includes expan-\\nsions of two of the appendices to Chapter 7. The appendices on activity dia-\\ngrams and on Business Process Management Notation now include additional \\ntext and figures. Throughout the book figures, tables, and related content \\nhave been updated and refreshed.\\n•\\t Updated content. Throughout the book, the content in each chapter has been \\nupdated where appropriate. We have expanded our coverage of multiple top-\\nics in Chapter 2. Examples of updates in other chapters include revising the \\ninformation on the information services (IS)/information technology job \\nmarket in Chapter 1. Another example is Chapter 13, where we have updated \\nand extended the section on information systems security. All screenshots \\ncome from current versions of leading software products. We have also made \\na special effort to update our reference lists, purging out-of-date material and \\nincluding current references.\\nPreface'),\n",

In our efforts to keep the book current and to streamline it, \\nthe coverage of some things was dropped from this edition. Chapter 1 no lon-\\nger includes Rapid Application Development. Chapter 12 no longer covers \\ndata warehouses or data marts. Chapter 13 no longer includes a section on \\nElectronic Performance Support Systems.\\n•\\t Organization. We have retained the organization of the book first introduced \\nin the Sixth Edition. We have 14 chapters and 6 appendices. The first appen-\\ndix follows Chapter 1. Four appendices follow Chapter 7, including the new \\none on business process modeling. The sixth appendix follows Chapter 8. \\nThis streamlined organization worked well in the Sixth and Seventh Editions, \\nso we decided to continue with it.\\n•\\t Approach to presentation of object-oriented material. We retain our approach to \\nobject-orientation (OO) from the last edition. Brief appendices related to \\nthe object-oriented approach continue to appear immediately after related \\nchapters. The OO appendices appear as follows: Chapter 3 features a spe-\\ncial OO section on IS project management. Chapter 7 now has three OO \\nappendices: one on use cases; one on sequence diagrams; and one about \\nactivity diagrams. (The fourth appendix to Chapter 7 is about Business \\nProcess Management Notation, which is not part of UML, although it is \\ngoverned by the Object Management Group (OMG).) Chapter 8 has a \\nspecial section on object-oriented database design. The rationale for this \\norganization is the same as in the past: to cleanly separate out structured \\nand object-oriented approaches so that instructors not teaching OO can \\nbypass it. On the other hand, instructors who want to expose their students \\nto object-orientation can now do so with minimal effort devoted to finding \\nthe relevant OO material.\\n•\\t Updated illustrations of technology. Screen captures have been updated through-\\nout the text to show examples using the latest versions of programming and \\nInternet development environments (including the latest versions of.NET, \\nVisio, and Microsoft Office) and user interface designs. Many references to \\nwebsites are provided for students to stay current with technology trends that \\naffect the analysis and design of information systems.\\nthemes of Modern Systems Analysis and Design\\n1.

Becoming a systems analyst is not a goal; it is a \\npath to a rich and diverse career that will allow you \\nto exercise and continue to develop a wide range of \\ntalents. We hope that this introductory part of the \\ntext helps open your mind to the opportunities of the \\nsystems analysis and design field and to the engaging \\n nature of systems work.\\nChapter 1 shows you what systems analysis and \\n design is all about and how it has evolved over the past \\nseveral decades. As businesses and systems have become \\nmore sophisticated and more complex, there has been \\nan increasing emphasis on speed in systems analysis \\nand design. Systems development began as an art, but \\nmost businesspeople soon realized this was not a tena-\\nble long-term solution to developing systems to support \\nbusiness processes. Systems development  became more \\nstructured and more like engineering, and managers \\nstressed the importance of planning, project manage-\\nment, and documentation. Now we are witnessing a \\n reaction against excesses in all three of these areas, and \\nthe focus has shifted to agile development. The evo-\\nlution of systems analysis and design and the current \\nfocus on agility are explained in Chapter 1. It is also \\nimportant, however, that you remember that systems \\nanalysis and design exists within a multifaceted orga-\\nnizational context that involves other organizational \\nmembers and external parties. Understanding systems \\ndevelopment requires an understanding not only of \\neach technique, tool, and method, but also of how \\nthese elements complement and support each other \\nwithin an organizational setting.\\nAs you read this book, you’ll also discover that the \\nsystems analysis and design field is constantly adapting \\nto new situations due to a strong commitment to con-\\nstant improvement. Our goal in this book is to provide \\nyou with a mosaic of the skills needed to work effectively \\nin any environment where you may find yourself, armed \\nwith the knowledge to determine the best practices for \\nthat situation and argue for them effectively.\\nChapter 2 presents an introduction to the many \\nsources from which software and software components \\ncan be obtained. Back when systems analysis and design \\nwas an art, all systems were written from scratch by in-\\nhouse experts. Businesses had little choice. Now there \\nis little excuse for in-house development, so it becomes \\ncrucial that systems analysts understand the software \\nindustry and the many different sources of software. \\nChapter 2 provides an initial map of the software indus-\\ntry landscape and explains most of the many choices \\navailable to systems analysts.\\nChapter 3 addresses a fundamental characteristic \\nof life as a systems analyst: working within the frame-\\nwork of projects with constrained resources. All systems-\\nrelated work demands attention to deadlines, working \\nwithin budgets, and coordinating the work of various \\npeople. The very nature of the systems development life \\ncycle (SDLC) implies a systematic approach to a project, \\nwhich is a group of related activities leading to a final \\ndeliverable. Projects must be planned, started, executed, \\nand completed. The planned work of the project must \\nbe represented so that all interested parties can review \\nand understand it. In your job as a systems analyst, you \\nwill have to work within the schedule and other project \\nplans, and thus it is important to understand the man-\\nagement process controlling your work.\\nFinally, Part I introduces the Petrie Electronics \\ncase. The Petrie case helps demonstrate how what you \\nlearn in each chapter might fit into a practical organi-\\nzational situation. The case begins after Chapter 2; the \\nremaining book chapters through Chapter 13 each have \\nan associated case installment. The first section intro-\\nduces the company and its existing information systems. \\nThis introduction provides insights into Petrie, which \\nwill help you understand the company more completely \\nwhen we look at the requirements and design for new \\nsystems in later case sections.\\nPart One \\nFoundations for Systems Development'),\n",

Although advances in information technology \\ncontinually give us new capabilities, the analysis and \\n design of information systems is driven from an organi-\\nzational perspective. An organization might consist of \\na whole  enterprise, specific departments, or individual \\nwork groups. Organizations can respond to and antici-\\npate problems and opportunities through innovative use \\nof information technology. Information systems analysis \\nand design is therefore an organizational improvement \\nprocess. Systems are built and rebuilt for organizational \\nbenefits. Benefits result from adding value during the \\nprocess of creating, producing, and supporting the \\n organization’s products and services. Thus the analy-\\nsis and design of information systems is based on your \\n understanding of the organization’s objectives, struc-\\nture, and processes, as well as your knowledge of how to \\n exploit information technology for advantage.\\nIn the current business environment, the Internet, \\nespecially the World Wide Web, has been firmly inte-\\ngrated into an organization’s way of doing business. \\n Although you are probably most familiar with marketing \\ndone on the web and web-based retailing sites, such as \\neBay or Amazon.com, the overwhelming majority of busi-\\nness use of the web is business-to-business applications. \\nThese applications run the gamut of everything busi-\\nnesses do, including transmitting orders and payments \\nto suppliers, fulfilling orders and collecting payments \\nfrom  customers, maintaining business relationships, and \\n establishing  electronic marketplaces where businesses \\ncan shop online for the best deals on resources they need \\nfor assembling their products and services. Although \\nthe Internet seems to pervade business these days, it is \\nimportant to remember that many of the key aspects of \\nbusiness— offering a product or service for sale, collecting \\npayment, paying  employees, maintaining supplier and cli-\\nent  relationships—have not changed.

And the growth \\nwill be global, with the number of cloud computing jobs in Brazil increasing by 186 \\npercent, the number of jobs in China and India almost doubling, and growth in \\ncloud-related jobs increasing by 66 percent in the United States. (See more about \\ncloud computing in Chapter 2.) With the challenges and opportunities of dealing \\nwith rapid advances in technology, it is difficult to imagine a more exciting career \\nchoice than information technology, and systems analysis and design is a big part of \\nthe IT landscape. Furthermore, analyzing and designing information systems will \\ngive you the chance to understand organizations at a depth and breadth that might \\ntake many more years to accomplish in other careers.\\nAn important (but not the only) result of systems analysis and design is \\n application software, software designed to support a specific organizational function \\nor process, such as inventory management, payroll, or market analysis. In  addition to \\napplication software, the total information system includes the hardware and systems \\nsoftware on which the application software runs, documentation and training materi-\\nals, the specific job roles associated with the overall system, controls, and the  people \\nwho use the software along with their work methods. Although we will  address all of \\nthese various dimensions of the overall system, we will emphasize application soft-\\nware development—your primary responsibility as a systems analyst.\\nIn the early years of computing, analysis and design was considered an art. Now \\nthat the need for systems and software has become so great, people in industry and \\nacademia have developed work methods that make analysis and design a disciplined \\nprocess. Our goal is to help you develop the knowledge and skills needed to under-\\nstand and follow such software engineering processes. Central to software engineer -\\ning processes (and to this book) are various methodologies, techniques, and tools \\nthat have been developed, tested, and widely used over the years to assist people like \\nyou during systems analysis and design.\\nMethodologies are comprehensive, multiple-step approaches to systems devel-\\nopment that will guide your work and influence the quality of your final product—\\nthe information system. A methodology adopted by an organization will be consis-\\ntent with its general management style (e.g., an organization’s orientation toward \\nconsensus management will influence its choice of systems development methodol-\\nogy). Most methodologies incorporate several development techniques.\\nTechniques are particular processes that you, as an analyst, will follow to help \\nensure that your work is well thought out, complete, and comprehensible to others \\non your project team. Techniques provide support for a wide range of tasks, includ-\\ning conducting thorough interviews to determine what your system should do, plan-\\nning and managing the activities in a systems development project, diagramming the \\nsystem’s logic, and designing the reports your system will generate.\\nTools are typically computer programs that make it easy to use and benefit \\nfrom techniques and to faithfully follow the guidelines of the overall development \\nmethodology. To be effective, techniques and tools must both be consistent with an \\norganization’s systems development methodology. Techniques and tools must make \\nit easy for systems developers to conduct the steps called for in the methodology. \\nThese three elements—methodologies, techniques, and tools—work together to \\nform an organizational approach to systems analysis and design (see Figure 1-1).\\nAlthough many people in organizations are responsible for systems analysis \\nand design, in most organizations the systems analyst has the primary responsibil-\\nity. When you begin your career in systems development, you will most likely begin \\nas a systems analyst or as a programmer with some systems analysis responsibilities. \\nThe primary role of a systems analyst is to study the problems and needs of an orga-\\nnization in order to determine how people, methods, and information technology \\ncan best be combined to bring about improvements in the organization.

You will learn how systems analysis and design has changed over the \\ndecades as computing has become more central to business. You will learn about \\nthe systems development life cycle, which provides the basic overall structure of the \\nsystems  development process and of this book. This chapter ends with a discussion \\nof some of the methodologies, techniques, and tools created to support the systems \\ndevelopment process.\\nA MoDErn ApproACh To SySTEMS AnAlySiS  \\nAnD DESign\\nThe analysis and design of computer-based information systems began in the 1950s. \\nSince then, the development environment has changed dramatically, driven by \\n organizational needs as well as by rapid changes in the technological capabilities \\nof computers. In the 1950s, development focused on the processes the software \\nperformed. Because computer power was a critical resource, efficiency of process -\\ning became the main goal. Computers were large, expensive, and not very reliable. \\nEmphasis was placed on automating existing processes, such as purchasing or paying, \\noften within single departments. All applications had to be developed in machine \\nlanguage or assembly language, and they had to be developed from scratch because \\nthere was no software industry. Because computers were so expensive, computer \\nmemory was also at a premium, so system developers conserved as much memory as \\npossible for data storage.\\nThe first procedural, or third-generation, computer programming languages did \\nnot become available until the beginning of the 1960s. Computers were still large and \\nexpensive, but the 1960s saw important breakthroughs in technology that  enabled the \\ndevelopment of smaller, faster, less expensive computers—minicomputers—and the \\n beginnings of the software industry. Most organizations still developed their  applications \\nfrom scratch using their in-house development staff. Systems  development was more an \\nart than a science. This view of systems development began to change in the 1970s, \\nhowever, as organizations started to realize how expensive it was to develop custom -\\nized information systems for every application. Systems development came to be more \\nMethodologies Tools\\nTechniques\\nFIgure 1-1 \\nAn organizational approach to systems \\nanalysis and design is driven by \\nmethodologies, techniques, and tools\\nSources: Top: Mitarart/Fotolia; Left:  \\nLev/Fotolia; Right: PaulPaladin/Fotolia'),\n",

Early  database \\nmanagement systems, using hierarchical and network models, helped bring discipline \\nto the storage and retrieval of data. The development of database management systems \\nhelped shift the focus of systems development from processes first to data first.\\nThe 1980s were marked by major breakthroughs in computing in organizations, \\nas microcomputers became key organizational tools. The software industry expanded \\ngreatly as more and more people began to write off-the-shelf software for microcom-\\nputers. Developers began to write more and more applications in fourth-generation \\nlanguages, which, unlike procedural languages, instructed a computer on what to \\ndo instead of how to do it. Computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools were \\ndeveloped to make systems developers’ work easier and more consistent. As com-\\nputers continued to get smaller, faster, and cheaper, and as the operating systems \\nfor computers moved away from line prompt interfaces to windows- and icon-based \\ninterfaces, organizations moved to applications with more graphics. Organizations \\ndeveloped less software in-house and bought relatively more from software vendors. \\nThe systems developer’s job went through a transition from builder to integrator.\\nThe systems development environment of the late 1990s focused on  systems \\n integration. Developers used visual programming environments, such as PowerBuilder \\nor Visual Basic, to design the user interfaces for systems that run on  client/server \\nplatforms. The database, which may be relational or object-oriented, and which may \\nhave been developed using software from firms such as Oracle, Microsoft, or Ingres, \\nresided on the server. In many cases, the application logic resided on the same server. \\nAlternatively, an organization may have decided to purchase its entire enterprise-wide \\nsystem from companies such as SAP AG or Oracle. Enterprise-wide systems are large, \\ncomplex systems that consist of a series of independent system modules. Developers \\nassemble systems by choosing and implementing specific modules. Starting in the \\nmiddle years of the 1990s, more and more systems development efforts focused on \\nthe Internet, especially the web.\\nToday there is continued focus on developing systems for the Internet and \\nfor firms’ intranets and extranets. As happened with traditional systems, Internet \\n developers now rely on computer-based tools to speed and simplify the development \\nof web-based systems. Many CASE tools directly support web application develop-\\nment. More and more, systems implementation involves a three-tier design, with the \\ndatabase on one server, the application on a second server, and client logic located \\non user machines. Another important development is the move to wireless system \\ncomponents. Wireless devices can access web-based applications from almost any-\\nwhere. Finally, the trend continues toward assembling systems from programs and \\ncomponents purchased off the shelf. In many cases, organizations do not develop the \\napplication in-house. They don’t even run the application in-house, choosing instead \\nto use the application on a per-use basis by accessing it through the cloud.\\nDEvEloping inForMATion SySTEMS  \\nAnD ThE SySTEMS DEvElopMEnT liFE CyClE\\nMost organizations find it beneficial to use a standard set of steps, called a systems \\ndevelopment methodology, to develop and support their information systems. Like \\nmany processes, the development of information systems often follows a life cycle. \\nFor example, a commercial product follows a life cycle in that it is created, tested, and \\nintroduced to the market. Its sales increase, peak, and decline. Finally, the product is \\nremoved from the market and replaced by something else. The systems  development \\nlife cycle (SDLC) is a common methodology for systems development in many orga-\\nnizations; it features several phases that mark the progress of the systems analysis and \\ndesign effort. Every textbook author and information systems development organi-\\nzation uses a slightly different life-cycle model, with anywhere from 3 to almost 20 \\nidentifiable phases.\\nSystems development \\nlife\\xa0cycle (SDLC)\\nThe traditional methodology used to \\ndevelop, maintain, and replace information \\nsystems.\\nSystems development \\nmethodology\\nA standard process followed in an \\norganization to conduct all the steps \\nnecessary to analyze, design, implement, \\nand maintain information systems.'),\n",

At \\nfirst glance, the life cycle appears to be a sequentially ordered set of phases, but it is \\nnot. The specific steps and their sequence are meant to be adapted as required for a \\nproject, consistent with management approaches. For example, in any given SDLC \\nphase, the project can return to an earlier phase if necessary. Similarly, if a commer-\\ncial product does not perform well just after its introduction, it may be temporarily \\n removed from the market and improved before being reintroduced. In the SDLC, \\nit is also possible to complete some activities in one phase in parallel with some \\nactivities of another phase. Sometimes the life cycle is iterative; that is, phases are \\nrepeated as required until an acceptable system is found. Some people consider the \\nlife cycle to be a spiral, in which we constantly cycle through the phases at different \\nlevels of detail (see Figure 1-3). However conceived, the systems development life \\ncycle used in an organization is an orderly set of activities conducted and planned \\nfor each development project. The skills required of a systems analyst apply to all \\nlife-cycle models. Software is the most obvious end product of the life cycle; other \\n essential outputs include documentation about the system and how it was devel-\\noped, as well as training for users.\\nEvery medium to large corporation and every custom software producer \\nwill have its own specific life cycle or systems development methodology in place \\nDesignImplementation\\nPlanning\\nMaintenance Analysis\\nFIgure 1-2 \\nSystems development life cycle\\nDesign Implementation\\nPlanning\\nMaintenance\\nGo/No Go Axis\\nAnalysis\\nFIgure 1-3 \\nEvolutionary model'),\n",

Even if a particular methodology does not look like a cycle, and \\nFigure 1-4 does not, you will probably discover that many of the SDLC steps are \\nperformed and SDLC techniques and tools are used. Learning about systems anal-\\nysis and design from the life-cycle approach will serve you well no matter which \\nsystems development methodology you use.\\nWhen you begin your first job, you will likely spend several weeks or months \\nlearning your organization’s SDLC and its associated methodologies, techniques, and \\ntools. In order to make this book as general as possible, we follow a rather generic \\nlife-cycle model, as described in more detail in Figure 1-5. Notice that our model is \\ncircular. We use this SDLC as one example of a methodology but, more important, \\nas a way to arrange the topics of systems analysis and design. Thus, what you learn \\nin this book, you can apply to almost any life cycle you might follow. As we describe \\nthis SDLC throughout the book, you will see that each phase has specific outcomes \\nand deliverables that feed important information to other phases. At the end of each \\nphase, a systems development project reaches a milestone and, as deliverables are \\nproduced, they are often reviewed by parties outside the project team. In the rest \\nof this section, we provide a brief overview of each SDLC phase. At the end of the \\nsection, we summarize this discussion in a table that lists the main deliverables or \\noutputs from each SDLC phase.\\nThe first phase in the SDLC is planning. In this phase, someone identifies the \\nneed for a new or enhanced system. In larger organizations, this recognition may be \\npart of a corporate and systems planning process. Information needs of the orga-\\nnization as a whole are examined, and projects to meet these needs are proactively \\nidentified.

These needs can then be prioritized and translated into \\na plan for the information systems department, including a schedule for developing \\nnew major systems. In smaller organizations (as well as in large ones), determination \\nof which systems to develop may be affected by ad hoc user requests submitted as \\nthe need for new or enhanced systems arises, as well as from a formalized informa-\\ntion planning process. In either case, during project identification and selection, an \\norganization determines whether resources should be devoted to the development \\nor enhancement of each information system under consideration. The outcome of \\nthe project identification and selection process is a determination of which systems \\ndevelopment projects should be undertaken by the organization, at least in terms of \\nan initial study.\\nTwo additional major activities are also performed during the planning phase: \\nthe formal, yet still preliminary, investigation of the system problem or opportu-\\nnity at hand and the presentation of reasons why the system should or should not \\nbe developed by the organization. A critical step at this point is determining the \\nscope of the proposed system. The project leader and initial team of systems analysts \\nalso produce a specific plan for the proposed project the team will follow using the \\n remaining SDLC steps. This baseline project plan customizes the standardized SDLC \\nand specifies the time and resources needed for its execution. The formal definition \\nof a project is based on the likelihood that the organization’s information systems \\ndepartment is able to develop a system that will solve the problem or exploit the \\n opportunity and determine whether the costs of developing the system outweigh the \\nbenefits it could provide. The final presentation of the business case for proceeding \\nwith the subsequent project phases is usually made by the project leader and other \\nteam members to someone in management or to a special management committee \\nwith the job of deciding which projects the organization will undertake.\\nThe second phase in the SDLC is analysis. During this phase, the analyst thor -\\noughly studies the organization’s current procedures and the information systems \\nused to perform organizational tasks. Analysis has two subphases. The first is require-\\nments determination. In this subphase, analysts work with users to determine what \\nthe users want from a proposed system. The requirements determination process \\nusually involves a careful study of any current systems, manual and computerized, \\nthat might be replaced or enhanced as part of the project.

The output of the analysis phase \\nis a description of (but not a detailed design for) the alternative solution recom-\\nmended by the analysis team. Once the recommendation is accepted by those with \\nfunding authority, the analysts can begin to make plans to acquire any hardware and \\nsystem software necessary to build or operate the system as proposed.\\nThe third phase in the SDLC is design. During design, analysts convert the \\n description of the recommended alternative solution into logical and then physi-\\ncal system specifications. The analysts must design all aspects of the system, from \\ninput and output screens to reports, databases, and computer processes. The analysts \\nmust then provide the physical specifics of the system they have designed, either as \\na model or as detailed documentation, to guide those who will build the new sys-\\ntem. That part of the design process that is independent of any specific hardware \\nor software platform is referred to as logical design. Theoretically, the system could \\nbe  implemented on any hardware and systems software. The idea is to make sure \\nthat the system functions as intended. Logical design concentrates on the business \\naspects of the system and tends to be oriented to a high level of specificity.\\nOnce the overall high-level design of the system is worked out, the analysts \\nbegin turning logical specifications into physical ones. This process is referred to \\nas physical design. As part of physical design, analysts design the various parts of \\nthe system to perform the physical operations necessary to facilitate data capture, \\nprocessing, and information output. This can be done in many ways, from creating \\na working model of the system to be implemented to writing detailed specifica-\\ntions describing all the different parts of the system and how they should be built. \\nIn many cases, the working model becomes the basis for the actual system to be \\nused. During physical design, the analyst team must determine many of the physi-\\ncal details necessary to build the final system, from the programming language \\nthe system will be written in, to the database system that will store the data, to the \\nhardware platform on which the system will run. Often the choices of language, \\ndatabase, and platform are already decided by the organization or by the client, \\nand at this point these information technologies must be taken into account in the \\nphysical design of the system. The final product of the design phase is the physical \\nsystem specifications in a form ready to be turned over to programmers and other \\nsystem builders for construction. Figure 1-6 illustrates the differences between logi-\\ncal and physical design.\\nThe fourth phase in the SDLC is implementation. The physical system speci-\\nfications, whether in the form of a detailed model or as detailed written specifi -\\ncations, are turned over to programmers as the first part of the implementation \\nphase. During implementation, analysts turn system specifications into a working \\nsystem that is tested and then put into use. Implementation includes coding, test-\\ning, and  installation. During coding, programmers write the programs that make \\nup the  system. Sometimes the code is generated by the same system used to build \\nthe  detailed model of the system. During testing, programmers and analysts test \\n individual programs and the entire system in order to find and correct errors. \\nDuring installation, the new system becomes part of the daily activities of the orga-\\nnization. Application software is installed, or loaded, on existing or new hardware, \\nand users are introduced to the new system and trained. Testing and installation \\nshould be planned for as early as the project initiation and planning phase; both \\ntesting and installation require extensive analysis in order to develop exactly the \\nright approach.\\nImplementation activities also include initial user support such as the final-\\nization of documentation, training programs, and ongoing user assistance. Note \\nthat documentation and training programs are finalized during implementation; \\ndocumentation is produced throughout the life cycle, and training (and educa-\\ntion)  occurs from the inception of a project. Implementation can continue for as \\nlong as the system exists, because ongoing user support is also part of implemen-\\ntation.

Many well-designed systems have failed \\nbecause the installation process was faulty. Even a well-designed system can fail if \\nimplementation is not well managed. Because the project team usually manages \\nimplementation, we stress implementation issues throughout this book.\\nThe fifth and final phase in the SDLC is maintenance. When a system (includ-\\ning its training, documentation, and support) is operating in an organization, users \\nsometimes find problems with how it works and often think of better ways to perform \\nits functions. Also, the organization’s needs with respect to the system change over \\ntime. In maintenance, programmers make the changes that users ask for and modify \\nthe system to reflect evolving business conditions. These changes are necessary to \\nkeep the system running and useful. In a sense, maintenance is not a separate phase \\nbut a repetition of the other life cycle phases required to study and implement the \\nneeded changes. One might think of maintenance as an overlay on the life cycle \\nrather than as a separate phase. The amount of time and effort devoted to mainte-\\nnance depends a great deal on the performance of the previous phases of the life \\ncycle. There inevitably comes a time, however, when an information system is no \\nlonger performing as desired, when maintenance costs become prohibitive, or when \\nan organization’s needs have changed substantially.

Often the distinction between major mainte-\\nnance and new development is not clear, which is another reason maintenance often \\n resembles the life cycle itself.\\nThe SDLC is a highly linked set of phases whose products feed the activities \\nin subsequent phases. Table 1-1 summarizes the outputs or products of each phase \\nbased on the in-text descriptions. The chapters on the SDLC phases will elaborate on \\nthe products of each phase as well as on how the products are developed.\\nThroughout the SDLC, the systems development project itself must be care-\\nfully planned and managed. The larger the systems project, the greater the need for \\nproject management. Several project management techniques have been developed \\nover the past decades, and many have been made more useful through automation. \\nChapter 3 contains a more detailed treatment of project planning and management \\ntechniques. Next, we will discuss some of the criticisms of the SDLC and present \\n alternatives developed to address those criticisms. First, however, we will introduce \\nyou to a specialized SDLC that focuses on security during development.\\nA SpECiAlizED SySTEMS DEvElopMEnT  \\nliFE CyClE\\nAlthough the basic SDLC provides an overview of the systems development process, \\nthe concept of the SDLC can also be applied to very specific aspects of the process. As \\nmentioned previously, the maintenance phase can be described in terms of the SDLC. \\nAnother example of a specialized SDLC is Microsoft’s Security Development Lifecycle \\n(SDL) (see http://www.microsoft.com/security/sdl/default.aspx for details). The \\nSecurity Development Lifecycle is depicted in Figure 1-7. First note how the five basic \\nphases of the development life cycle (in green) are not exactly the same as the five \\nphases of the SDLC we will use in this book. Three of the five phases are almost identi-\\ncal to the phases in our SDLC. The Microsoft SDL starts with “requirements,” which \\nis similar to “analysis”; this is followed by the design phase, which is followed by imple-\\nmentation. Our life cycle starts with planning and ends with maintenance. Both of \\nthese phases are peculiar to systems development in an organizational context, where \\nTable 1-1  Products of SDlC Phases\\nPhase Products, Outputs, or Deliverables\\nPlanning Priorities for systems and projects; an architecture for data, networks, \\nand selection hardware, and information systems management are \\nthe\\xa0result of associated systems\\nDetailed steps, or work plan, for project\\nSpecification of system scope and planning and high-level system \\nrequirements or features\\nAssignment of team members and other resources\\nSystem justification or business case\\nAnalysis Description of current system and where problems or opportunities exist, \\nwith a general recommendation on how to fix, enhance, or replace \\ncurrent system\\nExplanation of alternative systems and justification for chosen alternative\\nDesign Functional, detailed specifications of all system elements (data, \\nprocesses, inputs, and outputs)\\nTechnical, detailed specifications of all system elements (programs, files, \\nnetwork, system software, etc.)\\nAcquisition plan for new technology\\nImplementation Code, documentation, training procedures, and support capabilities\\nMaintenance New versions or releases of software with associated updates to \\ndocumentation, training, and support'),\n",

Careful \\nplanning is required to determine which systems will be developed for an organiza-\\ntion. Each system developed is an investment, and if the organization invests in a par-\\nticular system, it cannot invest in some alternative system or in something else, such \\nas a new store. Investment funds are limited, after all. Maintenance is also peculiar to \\nan organizational context. Once systems go into general use, the organization needs \\nto earn as much of a return on those investments as it can, so it is important that the \\nsystems run as long as possible. Companies such as Microsoft, which develop systems \\nfor others to use, do not need to worry about internal planning and maintenance \\nin their product life cycles. Instead, as they have limited control over systems once \\nthey have been sold, they are concerned about selling a mature and reliable prod-\\nuct. Therefore, they have two phases after implementation: verification and release. \\nVerification involves quality assurance for products before they are released. Release \\ninvolves all of the activities related to making the product available for general use. \\nNext, note the two parts of the SDL that precede and follow the main development \\nphases: training (in blue) and response (in orange). Two things make this particular \\nSDLC specialized to security issues: the two unique phases that begin and end the \\nlife cycle (training and response), and the particular security activities associated with \\neach phase in the development life cycle.\\nTraining in Microsoft’s SDL refers to the training each member of a develop-\\nment team receives about security basics and trends in security. The idea behind the \\ntraining—indeed, the idea behind a specialized security development life cycle—is \\nto have security become part of the development process from the beginning and \\nnot suddenly appear at the end of the SDLC. By training team members about \\n security and how it can be addressed throughout the life cycle, security measures \\ncan be built into the system throughout its development. The response at the end of \\nthe SDL refers to a response plan developed during the release phase. If there is a \\n security threat to a particular product, then the previously developed response plan is \\n executed. The security-related activities that take place throughout the development \\nlife cycle vary by phase. Listing and explaining each activity is beyond the scope of \\nthis chapter, but we can provide some examples. One specialized activity performed \\nduring the requirements phase is a separate analysis of requirements related to both \\nsecurity and privacy. During design, developers can model threats to a system and \\nconsider how those threats differ with different design options. During implementa-\\ntion, project team members can conduct static analyses of source code, looking for \\nsecurity threats. During verification, they can conduct dynamic analyses. As part of \\nthe release phase, team members develop the incident response plan, mentioned \\npreviously, and they conduct a final security review. By adhering to a specialized life \\ncycle devoted to security, project team members can ensure not only that security is \\naddressed, but that it is addressed in a planned, systematic manner.\\nThE hEArT oF ThE SySTEMS DEvElopMEnT \\nproCESS\\nThe SDLC provides a convenient way to think about the processes involved in sys-\\ntems development and the organization of this book.

Although almost all systems development projects \\nadhere to some type of life cycle, the exact location of activities and the specific \\nsequencing of steps can vary greatly from one project to the next. Current practice \\ncombines the activities traditionally thought of as belonging to analysis, design, and \\nimplementation into a single process.

To better understand these \\ncriticisms, it is best to see the form in which the life cycle has traditionally been por-\\ntrayed, the so-called waterfall (Figure 1-10). Note how the flow of the project begins \\nin the planning phase and from there runs “downhill” to each subsequent phase, \\njust like a stream that runs off a cliff. Although the original developer of the waterfall \\nmodel, W. W. Royce, called for feedback between phases in the waterfall, this feed-\\nback came to be ignored in implementation (Martin, 1999). It became too tempting \\nto ignore the need for feedback and to treat each phase as complete unto itself, \\nnever to be revisited once finished.\\nTraditionally, one phase ended and another began once a milestone had been \\nreached. The milestone usually took the form of some deliverable or prespecified \\noutput from the phase. For example, the design deliverable is the set of detailed physi-\\ncal design specifications. Once the milestone had been reached and the new phase \\ninitiated, it became difficult to go back. Even though business conditions continued \\nto change during the development process and analysts were pressured by users and \\nothers to alter the design to match changing conditions, it was necessary for the ana-\\nlysts to freeze the design at a particular point and go forward. The enormous amount \\nof effort and time necessary to implement a specific design meant that it would be \\nvery expensive to make changes in a system once it was developed. The traditional \\nwaterfall life cycle, then, had the property of locking users into requirements that had \\nbeen previously determined, even though those requirements might have changed.\\nYet another criticism of the traditional waterfall SDLC is that the role of system \\nusers or customers was narrowly defined (Kay, 2002). User roles were often relegated \\nto the requirements determination or analysis phases of the project, where it was \\nassumed that all of the requirements could be specified in advance. Such an assump-\\ntion, coupled with limited user involvement, reinforced the tendency of the waterfall \\nmodel to lock in requirements too early, even after business conditions had changed.\\nIn addition, under the traditional waterfall approach, nebulous and intangible \\nprocesses such as analysis and design are given hard-and-fast dates for completion, \\nMaintenance\\nPlanning\\nAnalysis\\nPhysical\\nDesign\\nImplementation\\nLogical\\nDesign\\nFIgure 1-10 \\nTraditional waterfall SDLC'),\n",

The focus \\non milestone deadlines, instead of on obtaining and interpreting feedback from the \\ndevelopment process, leads to too little focus on doing good analysis and design. The \\nfocus on deadlines leads to systems that do not match users’ needs and that require \\nextensive maintenance, unnecessarily increasing development costs. Finding and fix-\\ning a software problem after the delivery of the system is often far more expensive \\nthan finding and fixing it during analysis and design (Griss, 2003). The result of \\nfocusing on deadlines rather than on good practice is unnecessary rework and main-\\ntenance effort, both of which are expensive. According to some estimates, mainte-\\nnance costs account for 40 to 70 percent of systems development costs (Dorfman and \\nThayer, 1997). Given these problems, people working in systems development began \\nto look for better ways to conduct systems analysis and design.\\nDiFFErEnT ApproAChES To iMproving \\nDEvElopMEnT\\nIn the continuing effort to improve the systems analysis and design process, several \\ndifferent approaches have been developed. We will describe the more important \\n approaches in more detail in later chapters. Attempts to make systems development \\nless of an art and more of a science are usually referred to as systems engineering or soft-\\nware engineering. As the names indicate, rigorous engineering techniques have been \\napplied to systems development. One manifestation of the engineering approach is \\nCASE tools, which you will read about next.\\nCASE Tools\\nOther efforts to improve the systems development process have taken advantage of \\nthe benefits offered by computing technology itself. The result has been the creation \\nand fairly widespread use of computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools. \\nCASE tools have been developed for internal use and for sale by several leading \\nfirms, but the best known is the series of Rational tools made by IBM.\\nCASE tools are used to support a wide variety of SDLC activities. CASE tools \\ncan be used to help in multiple phases of the SDLC: project identification and \\n selection, project initiation and planning, analysis, design, and implementation and \\nmaintenance. An integrated and standard database called a repository is the common \\nmethod for providing product and tool integration, and has been a key factor in \\n enabling CASE to more easily manage larger, more complex projects and to seam-\\nlessly integrate data across various tools and products. The idea of a central reposi-\\ntory of information about a project is not new—the manual form of such a repository \\nis called a project dictionary or workbook.\\nThe general types of CASE tools are listed below:\\n•\\t Diagramming tools enable system process, data, and control structures to be \\nrepresented graphically.\\n•\\t Computer display and report generators help prototype how systems “look and \\nfeel.” Display (or form) and report generators make it easier for the systems \\n analyst to identify data requirements and relationships.\\n•\\t Analysis tools automatically check for incomplete, inconsistent, or incorrect \\nspecifications in diagrams, forms, and reports.\\n•\\t A central repository enables the integrated storage of specifications, diagrams, \\nreports, and project management information.\\n•\\t Documentation generators produce technical and user documentation in \\n standard formats.\\n•\\t Code generators enable the automatic generation of program and database def-\\ninition code directly from the design documents, diagrams, forms, and reports.\\nComputer-aided software \\n engineering (CASe) tools\\nSoftware tools that provide automated \\nsupport for some portion of the systems \\ndevelopment process.'),\n",

However, many organizations that use CASE \\ntools do not use them to support all phases of the SDLC. Some organizations may \\nextensively use the diagramming features but not the code generators. Table 1-2 sum-\\nmarizes how CASE is commonly used within each SDLC phase. There are a variety of \\nreasons why organizations choose to adopt CASE partially or not use it at all. These \\nreasons range from a lack of vision for applying CASE to all aspects of the SDLC, to \\nthe belief that CASE technology will fail to meet an organization’s unique system \\ndevelopment needs. In some organizations, CASE has been extremely successful, \\nwhereas in others it has not.\\nAgilE METhoDologiES\\nMany approaches to systems analysis and design have been developed over the years. \\nIn February 2001, many of the proponents of these alternative approaches met in \\nUtah and reached a consensus on several of the underlying principles their various \\napproaches contained. This consensus turned into a document they called “The \\nAgile Manifesto” (Table 1-3). According to Fowler (2003), the Agile Methodologies \\nshare three key principles: (1) a focus on adaptive rather than predictive method-\\nologies, (2) a focus on people rather than roles, and (3) a focus on self-adaptive \\nprocesses.\\nThe Agile Methodologies group argues that software development meth-\\nodologies adapted from engineering generally do not fit with real-world software \\n development (Fowler, 2003). In engineering disciplines, such as civil engineering, \\n requirements tend to be well understood. Once the creative and difficult work of \\n design is completed, construction becomes very predictable. In addition, construc-\\ntion may  account for as much as 90 percent of the total project effort. For software, on \\nthe other hand, requirements are rarely well understood, and they change continually \\nduring the lifetime of the project. Construction may account for as little as 15 percent \\nof the total project effort, with design constituting as much as 50 percent. Applying \\ntechniques that work well for predictable, stable projects, such as bridge building, \\ntend not to work well for fluid, design-heavy projects such as writing software, say \\nthe Agile Methodology proponents. What is needed are methodologies that embrace \\nchange and that are able to deal with a lack of predictability. One mechanism for \\ndealing with a lack of predictability, which all Agile Methodologies share, is iterative \\ndevelopment (Martin, 1999). Iterative development focuses on the frequent produc-\\ntion of working versions of a system that have a subset of the total number of required \\nfeatures. Iterative development provides feedback to customers and developers alike.\\nThe Agile Methodologies’ focus on people is an emphasis on individuals rather \\nthan on the roles that people perform (Fowler, 2003). The roles that people fill, of \\nTable 1-2  examples of CaSe Usage within the SDlC\\nSDLC Phase Key Activities CASE Tool Usage\\nProject identification  \\nand selection\\nDisplay and structure high-level \\norganizational information\\nDiagramming and matrix tools to create and structure information\\nProject initiation  \\nand planning\\nDevelop project scope and \\nfeasibility\\nRepository and documentation generators to develop project plans\\nAnalysis Determine and structure system \\nrequirements\\nDiagramming to create process, logic, and data models\\nLogical and physical  \\ndesign\\nCreate new system designs Form and report generators to prototype designs; analysis and documentation \\ngenerators to define specifications\\nImplementation Translate designs into an \\ninformation system\\nCode generators and analysis, form and report generators to develop system; \\ndocumentation generators to develop system and user documentation\\nMaintenance Evolve information system All tools are used (repeat life cycle)'),\n",

Fowler argues that the application of engineering principles to systems \\ndevelopment has resulted in a view of people as interchangeable units instead of a \\nview of people as talented individuals, each bringing something unique to the devel-\\nopment team.\\nThe Agile Methodologies promote a self-adaptive software development pro-\\ncess. As software is developed, the process used to develop it should be refined \\nand improved. Development teams can do this through a review process, often \\nassociated with the completion of iterations. The implication is that, as processes \\nare adapted, one would not expect to find a single monolithic methodology within \\na given corporation or enterprise. Instead, one would find many variations of the \\nmethodology, each of which reflects the particular talents and experience of the \\nteam using it.\\nAgile Methodologies are not for every project.

In fact, whether a systems development project is \\n organized in terms of Agile or more traditional methodologies depends on many dif-\\nferent considerations. If a project is considered to be high risk and highly complex, \\nand has a development team made up of hundreds of people, then more traditional \\nmethods will apply. Less risky, smaller, and simpler development efforts lend them-\\nselves more to Agile methods. Other determining factors include organizational \\npractice and standards, and the extent to which different parts of the system will be \\ncontracted out to others for development. Obviously, the larger the proportion of \\nthe system that will be outsourced, the more detailed the design specifications will \\nneed to be so that subcontractors can understand what is needed. Although not uni-\\nversally agreed upon, the key differences between these development approaches \\nare listed in Table 1-4, which is based on work by Boehm and Turner (2004).

The relevant parts of  eXtreme Programming \\nthat relate to design specifications are (1) how planning, analysis, design, and construc-\\ntion are all fused into a single phase of activity; and (2)\\xa0its unique way of  capturing \\nand  presenting system requirements and design specifications. With eXtreme \\nProgramming, all phases of the life cycle converge into a series of activities based on \\nthe basic processes of coding, testing, listening, and designing.\\nUnder this approach, coding and testing are intimately related parts of the same \\nprocess. The programmers who write the code also develop the tests. The emphasis \\nis on testing those things that can break or go wrong, not on testing  everything. \\nCode is tested very soon after it is written. The overall philosophy behind eXtreme \\nProgramming is that the code will be integrated into the system it is being developed \\nfor and tested within a few hours after it has been written. If all the tests run suc-\\ncessfully, then development proceeds. If not, the code is reworked until the tests are \\nsuccessful.\\nAnother part of eXtreme Programming that makes the code-and-test process \\nwork more smoothly is the practice of pair programming. All coding and testing is \\ndone by two people working together to write code and develop tests. Beck says that \\npair programming is not one person typing while the other one watches; rather, the \\ntwo programmers work together on the problem they are trying to solve, exchanging \\ninformation and insight and sharing skills. Compared to traditional coding practices, \\nthe advantages of pair programming include: (1) more (and better) communica-\\ntion among developers, (2) higher levels of productivity, (3) higher-quality code, and \\n(4)\\xa0reinforcement of the other practices in eXtreme Programming, such as the code-\\nand-test discipline (Beck & Andres, 2004). Although the eXtreme Programming pro-\\ncess has its advantages, just as with any other approach to systems development, it is \\nnot for everyone and is not applicable to every project.\\nobjECT -oriEnTED AnAlySiS AnD DESign\\nThere is no question that object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD) is becoming \\nmore and more popular (we elaborate on this approach later throughout the book). \\nOOAD is often called the third approach to systems development, after the process-\\noriented and data-oriented approaches. The object-oriented approach combines \\ndata and processes (called methods) into single entities called objects. Objects usually \\ncorrespond to the real things an information system deals with, such as customers, \\nsuppliers, contracts, and rental agreements. Putting data and processes together in \\none place recognizes the fact that there are a limited number of operations for any \\ngiven data structure, and the object-oriented approach makes sense even though \\ntypical systems development keeps data and processes independent of each other. \\nThe goal of OOAD is to make systems elements more reusable, thus improving sys-\\ntem quality and the productivity of systems analysis and design.\\nAnother key idea behind object orientation is inheritance. Objects are orga-\\nnized into object classes, which are groups of objects sharing structural and behav-\\nioral characteristics. Inheritance allows the creation of new classes that share some of \\nthe characteristics of existing classes. For example, from a class of objects called “per-\\nson,” you can use inheritance to define another class of objects called “customer.” \\nObjects of the class “customer” would share certain characteristics with objects of the \\nclass “person”: They would both have names, addresses, phone numbers, and so on. \\nBecause “person” is the more general class and “customer” is more specific, every \\ncustomer is a person but not every person is a customer.\\nAs you might expect, a computer programming language is required that can \\ncreate and manipulate objects and classes of objects in order to create object-oriented \\ninformation systems. Several object-oriented programming languages have been cre-\\nated (e.g., C++, Eiffel, and Java). In fact, object-oriented languages were developed \\nObject\\nA structure that encapsulates (or packages) \\nattributes and methods that operate on \\nthose attributes. An object is an abstraction \\nof a real-world thing in which data and \\nprocesses are placed together to model \\nthe structure and behavior of the real-world \\nobject.\\nObject-oriented analysis  \\nand design (OOAD)\\nSystems development methodologies and \\ntechniques based on objects rather than \\ndata or processes.\\nObject class\\nA logical grouping of objects that have the \\nsame (or similar) attributes and behaviors \\n(methods).\\nInheritance\\nThe property that occurs when entity \\ntypes or object classes are arranged in a \\nhierarchy and each entity type or object \\nclass assumes the attributes and methods \\nof its ancestors, that is, those higher up in \\nthe hierarchy.

Because OOAD \\nis still relatively new, there is little consensus or standardization among the many \\nOOAD techniques available. In general, the primary task of object-oriented analysis \\nis identifying objects and defining their structure and behavior and their relation-\\nships. The primary tasks of object-oriented design are modeling the details of the \\nobjects’ behavior and communication with other objects so that system requirements \\nare met, and reexamining and redefining objects to better take advantage of inheri-\\ntance and other benefits of object orientation.\\nThe object-oriented approach to systems development shares the iterative \\n development approach of the Agile Methodologies. Some say that the current focus \\non agility in systems development is nothing more than the mainstream acceptance \\nof object-oriented approaches that have been germinating for years, so this similar-\\nity should come as no surprise (Fowler, 2003). One of the most popular realizations \\nof the iterative approach for object-oriented development is the Rational Unified \\nProcess (RUP), which is based on an iterative, incremental approach to systems \\n development. RUP has four phases: inception, elaboration, construction, and transi-\\ntion (see Figure 1-11).\\nIn the inception phase, analysts define the scope, determine the feasibility of \\nthe project, understand user requirements, and prepare a software development \\nplan. In the elaboration phase, analysts detail user requirements and develop a base-\\nline architecture. Analysis and design activities constitute the bulk of the elaboration \\nphase. In the construction phase, the software is actually coded, tested, and docu-\\nmented. In the transition phase, the system is deployed, and the users are trained \\nand supported. As is evident from Figure 1-11, the construction phase is generally \\nthe longest and the most resource intensive. The elaboration phase is also long, but \\nless resource intensive. The transition phase is resource intensive but short. The \\n inception phase is short and the least resource intensive. The areas of the rectangles \\nin Figure 1-11 provide an estimate of the overall resources allocated to each phase.\\nEach phase can be further divided into iterations. The software is developed \\nincrementally as a series of iterations. The inception phase will generally entail \\na single iteration. The scope and feasibility of the project is determined at this \\nrational unified Process \\n(ruP)\\nAn object-oriented systems development \\nmethodology.

The elaboration phase may have one or two iterations and is generally con-\\nsidered the most critical of the four phases (Kruchten, 2000). The elaboration \\nphase is mainly about systems analysis and design, although other activities are \\nalso involved. At the end of the elaboration phase, the architecture of the project \\nshould have been developed. The architecture includes a vision of the product, an \\nexecutable demonstration of the critical pieces, a detailed glossary and a prelimi-\\nnary user manual, a detailed construction plan, and a revised estimate of planned \\nexpenditures.\\nAlthough the construction phase mainly involves coding, which is accom-\\nplished in several iterations, revised user requirements could require analysis and \\ndesign. The components are developed or purchased and used in the code. As each \\nexecutable is completed, it is tested and integrated. At the end of the construction \\nphase, a beta version of the project is released that should have operational capa-\\nbilities. The transition phase entails correcting problems, beta testing, user training, \\nand conversion of the product. The transition phase is complete when the project \\nobjectives meet the acceptance criteria. Once acceptance criteria have been met, the \\nproduct can then be released for distribution.\\nour ApproACh To SySTEMS DEvElopMEnT\\nMuch of the criticism of the SDLC has been based on abuses of the life cycle per -\\nspective, both real and imagined. One of the criticisms, one based in reality, is that \\nreliance on the life-cycle approach forced intangible and dynamic processes, such \\nas analysis and design, into timed phases that were doomed to fail (Martin, 1999). \\nDeveloping software is not like building a bridge, and the same types of engineer-\\ning processes cannot always be applied (Fowler, 2003), even though viewing software \\ndevelopment as a science rather than an art has no doubt resulted in vast improve-\\nments in the process and the resulting products. Another criticism with its basis in \\nfact is that life cycle reliance has resulted in massive amounts of process and docu-\\nmentation, much of which seems to exist for its own sake. Too much process and \\ndocumentation does slow down development, hence the streamlining that underlies \\nthe Agile Methodologies and the admonition from Agile developers that source code \\nis enough documentation. A criticism of the SDLC that is based more on fiction \\nis that all versions of the SDLC are waterfall-like, with no feedback between steps. \\nAnother false criticism is that a life-cycle approach necessarily limits the involvement \\nof users in the earliest stages of the process. Yet Agile Methodologies, and eXtreme \\nProgramming in particular, advocate an analysis–design–code–test sequence that is a \\ncycle (Figure 1-8), and users can be and are involved in every step of this cycle; thus, \\ncycles in and of themselves do not necessarily limit user involvement.\\nWhether the criticisms have been based on fact or not, however, it is true that \\nthe traditional SDLC waterfall approach has problems, and we applaud the changes \\ntaking place in the systems development community. These changes are allowing \\nproblems with traditional approaches to be fixed, and without a doubt the result is \\nbetter software produced more expertly and more quickly.\\nHowever, despite the criticisms of a life-cycle approach to systems analysis and \\ndesign, the view of systems analysis and design taking place in a cycle continues to be \\npervasive, and, we think, true as well. There are many types of cycles, from the water-\\nfall to the analysis–design–code–test cycle, and they all capture the iterative nature of \\nsystems development. The waterfall approach may be losing its relevance, but the cycle \\nin Figure 1-8 is gaining in popularity, and the analysis–design–code–test cycle is embed-\\nded in a larger organizational cycle. Although we typically use the terms systems analysis \\nand design and systems development interchangeably, perhaps it is better to think about \\nsystems analysis and design as being the cycle in Figure 1-8 and systems development as \\nbeing the larger cycle in Figure 1-2. The analysis– design–code–test cycle largely ignores \\nthe organizational planning that precedes it and the organizational installation and '),\n",

And to us, the best, clearest way to think about both efforts is in \\nterms of cycles.\\nTherefore, in this book you will see Figure 1-2 at the beginning of almost every \\nchapter. We will use our SDLC as an organizing principle in this book, with activities \\nand processes arranged according to whether they fit under the category of planning, \\nanalysis, design, implementation, or maintenance. To some extent, we will artificially \\nseparate activities and processes so that each one can be individually studied and \\n understood. Once individual components are clearly understood, it is easier to see \\nhow they fit with other components, and eventually it becomes easy to see the whole. \\nJust as we may artificially separate activities and processes, we may also  construct arti-\\nficial boundaries between phases of the SDLC. Our imposition of boundaries should \\nnever be interpreted as hard-and-fast divisions. In practice, as we have seen with the \\nAgile Methodologies and in the introduction to OOAD, phases and parts of phases \\nmay be combined for speed, understanding, and efficiency. Our intent is to intro-\\nduce the pieces in a logical manner, so that you can understand all the pieces and \\nhow to assemble them in the best way for your systems development purposes. Yet the \\noverall structure of the cycle, of iteration, remains throughout. Think of the cycle as \\nan organizing and guiding principle.\\nSummary\\nThis chapter introduced you to information systems analy-\\nsis and design, the complex organizational process whereby \\ncomputer-based information systems are developed and \\nmaintained. You read about how systems analysis and  design \\nin organizations has changed over the past  several decades. \\nYou also learned about the basic framework that guides \\nsystems analysis and design—the systems development life \\ncycle (SDLC), with its five major phases:  planning, analysis, \\ndesign, implementation, and maintenance. The SDLC life \\ncycle has had its share of criticism, which you read about, \\nand other frameworks have been developed to address the \\nlife cycle’s problems. These approaches  include computer-\\naided software engineering (CASE) tools and the Agile \\nMethodologies, the most famous of which is eXtreme \\nProgramming. You were also briefly introduced to object-\\noriented analysis and design, an approach that is becoming \\nmore and more popular. All of these approaches share the \\nunderlying idea of iteration, as manifested in the systems \\ndevelopment life cycle and the analysis–design–code–test \\ncycle of the Agile Methodologies.\\nKey TermS\\n 1.1 Analysis\\n 1.2 Application software\\n 1.3 Computer-aided software \\n engineering (CASE) tools\\n 1.4 Design\\n 1.5 Implementation\\n 1.6 Information systems analysis \\nand\\xa0design\\n 1.7 Inheritance\\n 1.8 Logical design\\n 1.9 Maintenance\\n 1.10 Object\\n 1.11 Object class\\n 1.12 Object-oriented analysis and design \\n(OOAD)\\n 1.13 Physical design\\n 1.14 Planning\\n 1.15 Rational Unified Process  \\n(RUP)\\n 1.16 Systems analyst\\n 1.17 Systems development life cycle \\n(SDLC)\\n 1.18 Systems development  \\nmethodology\\nMatch each of the key terms above with the definition that best \\nfits it.\\n____ The complex organizational process whereby computer-\\nbased information systems are developed and maintained.\\n____ Computer software designed to support organizational \\nfunctions or processes.\\n____ The organizational role most responsible for the analysis \\nand design of information systems.\\n____ A standard process followed in an organization to conduct \\nall the steps necessary to analyze, design, implement, and \\nmaintain information systems.\\n____ The traditional methodology used to develop, maintain, \\nand replace information systems.\\n____ The first phase of the SDLC, in which an organization’s \\n total information system needs are identified, analyzed, \\nprioritized, and arranged.'),\n",

The first source considered is \\noutsourcing, in which all or part of an  organization’s infor-\\nmation systems, their development, and their maintenance \\nare given over to another organization. You will then read \\nabout six different sources of software: (1)\\xa0information \\ntechnology services firms, (2) packaged software providers, \\n(3) vendors of enterprise-wide solution software, (4) cloud \\ncomputing, (5) open-source software, and (6) the organiza-\\ntion itself when it develops software in-house. You will learn \\nabout criteria to evaluate software from these different \\nsources. The chapter closes with a discussion of reuse and \\nits impact on software development.\\nSyStemS AcquiSition\\nAlthough there will always be some debate about when and \\nwhere the first administrative information system was devel-\\noped, there is general agreement that the first such system \\nin the United Kingdom was developed at J. Lyons & Sons. \\nIn the United States, the first administrative information sys-\\ntem was General Electric’s (GE) payroll system, which was \\ndeveloped in 1954 (Computer History Museum, 2003). At \\nthat time, and for many years afterward, obtaining an infor-\\nmation system meant one thing only: in-house development. \\nThe software industry did not even come into existence until \\na decade after GE’s payroll system was implemented.\\nAs you learned in Chapter 1, there was a time, not too \\nlong ago, when no systems analysts and no symbolic com-\\nputer programming languages existed. Yet people still \\nwrote and programmed applications for computers. In \\nChapter 1 you read about the changes over the last  60-plus \\nyears. Even though today’s systems analyst has dozens of \\nprogramming languages and development tools to work \\nwith, you could easily argue that systems  development is \\neven more difficult now than it was 60\\xa0years ago. Then, \\nas well as even more recently, certain issues were decided \\nfor you: If you wanted to write application software, you \\ndid it in-house, and you wrote the software from scratch. \\nToday there are many different sources of software, and \\nmany of you reading this book will end up working for \\nfirms that produce software, rather than in the informa-\\ntion systems department of a corporation. But for those \\nof you who do go on to work in a corporate information \\nsystems department, the focus is no longer exclusively \\non in-house  development. Instead, the focus will be on \\nwhere to  obtain the many pieces and components that \\nyou will combine into the application system you have \\nbeen asked to create. You and your peers will still write \\ncode, mainly to make all the different pieces work to-\\ngether, but more and more of your application software \\nwill be written by someone else. Even though you will \\nnot write the code, you will still use the basic structure \\nand processes of the systems analysis and design life \\ncycle to build the  application systems your organization \\n demands. The organizational process of systems develop-\\nment remains the focus for the rest of the book, but first \\n2.3 discuss how to evaluate off-the-shelf software, and\\n2.4 explain reuse and its role in software development.\\nLearning Objectives\\nAfter studying this chapter, you should be able to\\n2.1 explain outsourcing,\\n2.2 describe six different sources of software,\\nthe origins of Software\\n2\\nchapter\\nIntroduction'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\ASUS\\\\Desktop\\\\AI powered chatbot\\\\Data\\\\SAD.pdf', 'page': 51}, page_content=' Chapter 2   The Origins Of sOfTware 27\\nSince GE’s payroll system was built, in-house development has become a pro-\\ngressively smaller piece of all the systems development work that takes place in and \\nfor organizations. Internal corporate information systems departments now spend \\na smaller and smaller proportion of their time and effort on developing systems \\nfrom scratch. Companies continue to spend relatively little time and money on tra-\\nditional software development and maintenance. Instead, they invest in packaged \\nsoftware, open-source software, and outsourced services. Organizations today have \\nmany choices when seeking an information system. We will start with a discussion of \\noutsourcing development and operation and then move on to a presentation on the \\nsources of software.\\noutsourcing\\nIf one organization develops or runs a computer application for another orga-\\nnization, that practice is called outsourcing. Outsourcing includes a spectrum \\nof  working arrangements. At one extreme is having a firm develop and run your \\n application on its computers—all you do is supply input and take output. A com-\\nmon example of such an arrangement is a company that runs payroll applications \\nfor clients so that clients do not have to develop an independent in-house pay-\\nroll system. Instead, they simply provide employee payroll information to the com-\\npany, and, for a fee, the company returns completed paychecks, payroll accounting \\n reports, and tax and other statements for employees. For many organizations, pay-\\nroll is a very cost-effective operation when outsourced in this way. Another example \\nof outsourcing would be if you hired a company to run your applications at your \\nsite on your computers. In some cases, an organization employing such an arrange-\\nment will dissolve some or all of its information systems (IS) unit and fire all of its \\nIS employees. Often the company brought in to run the organization’s computing \\nwill rehire many of the organization’s original IS unit employees.\\nOutsourcing is big business. Some organizations outsource the information \\ntechnology (IT) development of many of their IT functions at a cost of billions of \\ndollars. Most organizations outsource at least some aspect of their information sys-\\ntems activities. One example of the extent of outsourcing is Shell Oil. In 2008, Shell \\nsigned outsourcing contracts with EDS, T-Systems, and AT&T worth $3.2 billion \\nUSD. In addition, Shell signed application support deals with IBM, Logica, Wipro, \\nand Accenture. In 2011, Shell outsourced all of its SAP-based human resources and \\npayroll application management services to Accenture. More than 90,000 Shell em-\\nployees in 60 countries around the world use these systems. Accenture delivers these \\nservices through outsourcing centers in India and the Philippines. Individual out-\\nsourcing vendors, such as EDS, IBM, and Accenture, typically sign large contracts for \\ntheir services. These vendors have multiple outsourcing contracts in place with many \\ndifferent firms all over the world.\\nWhy would an organization outsource its information systems operations? As \\nwe saw in the payroll example, outsourcing may be cost-effective. If a company spe-\\ncializes in running payroll for other companies, it can leverage the economies of \\nscale it achieves from running one stable computer application for many organiza-\\ntions into very low prices. Outsourcing also provides a way for firms to leapfrog their \\ncurrent position in information systems and to turn over development and opera-\\ntions to outside staff who possess knowledge and skills not found internally (Ketler \\nand Willems, 1999). Other reasons for outsourcing include\\n•\\t freeing up internal resources,\\n•\\t increasing the revenue potential of the organization,\\n•\\t reducing time to market,\\n•\\t increasing process efficiencies, and\\n•\\t outsourcing noncore activities.\\nOutsourcing\\nThe practice of turning over responsibility \\nfor some or all of an organization’s \\ninformation systems applications and \\noperations to an outside firm.'),\n",

For example, the city of Grand \\nRapids, Michigan, hired an outside firm to run its computing center 40 years ago in \\norder to better manage its computing center employees. Union contracts and civil \\nservice constraints then in force made it difficult to fire people, so the city brought \\nin a facilities management organization to run its computing operations, and it was \\nable to get rid of problem employees at the same time. As mentioned earlier,  another \\nreason for total outsourcing is that an organization’s management may feel its core \\nmission does not involve managing an information systems unit and that it might \\nachieve more effective computing by turning over all of its operations to a more \\nexperienced, computer-oriented company. Kodak decided in the late 1980s that \\nit was not in the computer applications business and turned over management of \\nits mainframes to IBM and management of its personal computers to Businessland \\n(Applegate and Montealagre, 1991).\\nAlthough you have most likely heard about outsourcing in terms of IT jobs from \\nall over the world going to India, it turns out that the global outsourcing marketplace \\nis much more complicated. According to a 2014 report by ATKearney (2014), India \\nis the number one outsourcing nation, while China is close behind, and Malaysia is \\nthird. Despite much turmoil in the overall outsourcing market over the years, the top \\nthree rankings have not changed since ATKearney’s first report on outsourcing in \\n2003. Not all of the 2014 top 10 outsourcing countries are located in Asia. Although \\nsix are in Asia, two are in Latin America (Mexico and Brazil), one is in Europe \\n(Bulgaria), and one is in Africa (Egypt). Even the United States is an outsourcing \\nnation, number 14 on the ATKearney list. In fact, Indian outsourcing firms, such as \\nWipro, Infosys, and Tata Consulting, operate offices in the United States. As Indian \\nfirms have become so successful at offshoring, and as currencies have fluctuated, it \\nhas become more expensive for firms to contract with Indian companies, so many \\nfirms have started to look elsewhere. Many US firms have turned to what is called \\nnearshoring, or contracting with companies in Latin American countries. Many of \\nthese countries are no more than one time zone away, and they maintain some of the \\nlabor cost advantages that are eroding in India (King, 2008a). Mexico is increasingly \\nseen as a complement to India and other offshore locations and is listed as number \\nfour in the ATKearney 2014 list. It is also becoming more common for firms to dis-\\ntribute their outsourcing work across vendors in several countries at the same time.\\nAnalysts need to be aware of outsourcing as an alternative. When generating \\nalternative system development strategies for a system, as an analyst you should con-\\nsult organizations in your area that provide outsourcing services. It may well be that \\nat least one such organization has already developed and is running an application \\nvery close to what your users are asking for. Perhaps outsourcing the replacement \\nsystem should be one of your alternatives. Knowing what your system requirements \\nare before you consider outsourcing means that you can carefully assess how well the \\nsuppliers of outsourcing services can respond to your needs. However, should you \\ndecide not to consider outsourcing, you need to determine whether some software \\ncomponents of your replacement system should be purchased and not built in-house.\\nSources of Software\\nWe can group the sources of software into six major categories: information tech-\\nnology services firms, packaged software producers, enterprise-wide solutions, cloud \\ncomputing vendors, open-source software, and in-house developers (Figure 2-1). \\nThese various sources represent points along a continuum of options, with many \\nhybrid combinations along the way.\\nInformation Technology Services Firms If a company needs an information system \\nbut does not have the expertise or the personnel to develop the system in-house, '),\n",

IT services firms help companies develop \\ncustom information systems for internal use, or they develop, host, and run applica-\\ntions for customers, or they provide other services. Note in Table 2-1 that many of \\nthe leading software companies in the world specialize in services, which include \\ncustom systems development. These firms employ people with expertise in the devel-\\nopment of information systems. Their consultants may also have expertise in a given \\nbusiness area.

Consultants use many of the same meth-\\nodologies, techniques, and tools that companies use to develop systems in-house. \\nIt may surprise you to see IBM listed as a top global software producer; some \\npeople still think of it as primarily a hardware company. Yet IBM has been moving \\naway from a reliance on hardware development for many years. The purchase of the \\nIT consulting arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers by IBM in 2002 solidified its move into \\nservices and consulting. IBM is also well known for its development of web server \\nand middleware software. Other leading IT services firms include traditional consult-\\ning firms, such as Computer Sciences Corp., Accenture, and HP (Hewlett-Packard). \\nHP, another company formerly focused on hardware, has made the transition to an \\nIT services firm. In 2008, HP bought EDS, continuing its transition to a services-\\noriented company.\\nPackaged Software Producers  The growth of the software industry has been \\nphenomenal since its beginnings in the mid-1960s. Some of the largest computer \\ncompanies in the world are companies that produce software exclusively. A good \\nexample is Microsoft, probably the best-known software company in the world. \\nAlmost 87 percent of Microsoft’s revenue comes from its software sales, mostly for \\nits Windows operating systems and its personal productivity software, the Microsoft \\nOffice Suite. Also listed in Table 2-1, Oracle is exclusively a software company \\nknown primarily for its database software, but Oracle also makes enterprise sys-\\ntems. Another company on the list, SAP, is also a software-focused company that \\ndevelops enterprise-wide system solutions. You will read more about Oracle and \\nSAP shortly, in the section on enterprise systems. \\nSoftware companies develop what are sometimes called prepackaged or off-the-shelf \\nsystems. Microsoft’s Word (Figure 2-2) and Intuit’s Quicken, QuickPay, and QuickBooks \\nare popular examples of such software. The packaged software development indus -\\ntry serves many market segments. Their software offerings range from general, broad-\\nbased packages, such as productivity tools, to very narrow, niche packages, such as \\n software to help manage a day care center. Software companies develop software to run \\non many different computer platforms, from microcomputers to large mainframes. \\nThe companies range in size from just a few people to thousands of employees.\\nFigure 2-2\\nA document created in Microsoft’s Word \\n(Source: Microsoft Corporation.)'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\ASUS\\\\Desktop\\\\AI powered chatbot\\\\Data\\\\SAD.pdf', 'page': 55}, page_content=' Chapter 2   The Origins Of sOfTware 31\\nSoftware companies consult with system users after the initial software design \\nhas been completed and an early version of the system has been built. The systems \\nare then tested in actual organizations to determine whether there are any problems \\nor if any improvements can be made. Until testing is completed, the system is not \\n offered for sale to the public.\\nSome off-the-shelf software systems cannot be modified to meet the specific, \\n individual needs of a particular organization. Such application systems are some-\\ntimes called turnkey systems. The producer of a turnkey system will make changes \\nto the software only when a substantial number of users ask for a specific change. \\nHowever, other off-the-shelf application software can be modified or extended, by \\nthe producer or by the user, to more closely fit the needs of the organization. Even \\nthough many organizations perform similar functions, no two organizations do the \\nsame thing in quite the same way. A turnkey system may be good enough for a certain \\nlevel of performance, but it will never perfectly match the way a given organization \\ndoes business. A reasonable estimate is that off-the-shelf software can at best meet \\n70 percent of an organization’s needs. Thus, even in the best case, 30 percent of the \\nsoftware system does not match the organization’s specifications.\\nEnterprise Solutions Software As mentioned in Chapter 1, many firms have  chosen \\ncomplete software solutions, called enterprise solutions or enterprise resource plan-\\nning (ERP) systems, to support their operations and business processes. These ERP \\nsoftware solutions consist of a series of integrated modules. Each module  supports \\nan individual, traditional business function, such as accounting, distribution, manu-\\nfacturing, or human resources. The difference between the modules and traditional \\napproaches is that the modules are integrated to focus on business processes rather \\nthan on business functional areas. For example, a series of modules will support \\nthe entire order entry process, from receiving an order, to adjusting inventory, to \\nshipping to billing, to after-the-sale service. The traditional approach would use dif-\\nferent systems in different functional areas of the business, such as a billing system \\nin  accounting and an inventory system in the warehouse. Using enterprise software \\nsolutions, a firm can integrate all parts of a business process in a unified information \\nsystem. All aspects of a single transaction occur seamlessly within a single informa-\\ntion system, rather than as a series of disjointed, separate systems focused on busi -\\nness functional areas.\\nThe benefits of the enterprise solutions approach include a single repository of \\ndata for all aspects of a business process and the flexibility of the modules. A single \\nrepository ensures more consistent and accurate data, as well as less maintenance. \\nThe modules are flexible because additional modules can be added as needed once \\nthe basic system is in place. Added modules are immediately integrated into the \\nexisting system. However, there are disadvantages to enterprise solutions software. \\nThe systems are very complex, so implementation can take a long time to complete. \\nOrganizations typically do not have the necessary expertise in-house to implement \\nthe systems, so they must rely on consultants or employees of the software vendor, \\nwhich can be very expensive. In some cases, organizations must change how they do \\nbusiness in order to benefit from a migration to enterprise solutions.\\nSeveral major vendors provide enterprise solution software. The best known \\nis probably SAP AG, the German firm mentioned earlier, known for its flagship \\n product R/3. SAP stands for Systems, Applications, and Products in Data Processing. \\nSAP AG was founded in 1972, but most of its growth has occurred since 1992. Since \\n2010, SAP has been one of the largest suppliers of software in the world. The other \\nmajor vendor of enterprise solutions is Oracle Corp., a  US-based firm, perhaps \\nbetter known for its database software. Oracle captured a large share of the ERP \\nmarket through its own financial systems and through the acquisition of other ERP \\nvendors. At the end of 2004, Oracle acquired PeopleSoft, Inc., a US\\xa0firm founded \\nin 1987. PeopleSoft began with enterprise solutions that focused on human re-\\nsources management and expanded to cover financials, materials management, \\nenterprise resource planning \\n(erP) systems\\nA system that integrates individual \\ntraditional business functions into a series of \\nmodules so that a single transaction occurs \\nseamlessly within a single information \\nsystem rather than several separate systems.'),\n",

Just before being \\npurchased by Oracle, PeopleSoft had boosted its corporate strength in 2003 \\nthrough acquiring another ERP vendor, JD Edwards. Together, SAP and Oracle \\ncontrol about 36 percent of the ERP market (Compare Business Products, 2014). \\nBecause the higher end of the market has become saturated with ERP systems, \\nmost ERP vendors are looking to medium and small businesses for growth. For \\nexample, SAP’s offering for medium and small businesses is called SAP Business \\nByDesign (Figure 2-3).\\nCloud Computing Another method for organizations to obtain applications is to \\nrent them or license them from third-party providers who run the applications at \\nremote sites. Users have access to the applications through the Internet or through \\nvirtual private networks. The application provider buys, installs, maintains, and \\n upgrades the applications. Users pay on a per-use basis or they license the software, \\ntypically month to month. Although this practice has been known by many different \\nnames over the years, today it is called cloud computing. Cloud computing  refers to \\nthe provision of applications over the Internet, where customers do not have to invest \\nin the hardware and software resources needed to run and maintain the  applications. \\nYou may have seen the Internet referred to as a cloud in other contexts, which comes \\nfrom how the Internet is depicted on computer network diagrams. A well-known \\nexample of cloud computing is Google Apps, where users can share and create docu-\\nments, spreadsheets, and presentations (Figure 2-4). Another well-known example is \\nSalesforce.com, which provides customer relationship management software online. \\nCloud computing encompasses many areas of technology, including software as a \\nservice (often referred to as SaaS), which includes Salesforce.com, and hardware as \\na service, which includes Amazon Web Services and allows companies to order server \\ncapacity and storage on demand.\\nMicrosoft and IDC predicted that cloud computing would create 14 million \\nnew jobs by 2015 and that the total global market for cloud computing would reach \\n$1.1 trillion USD that year (McDougall, 2012).

These include such well-known names as IBM, which has built \\nmultiple cloud computing centers worldwide; Microsoft, which in 2008 announced \\nits Azure platform to support the development and operation of business applica-\\ntions and consumer services on its own servers; and Amazon.com, which provides \\nstorage and capacity from its own servers to customers.\\nAs these growth forecasts indicate, taking the cloud computing route has its \\nadvantages. The top three reasons for choosing to go with cloud computing, all of \\nwhich result in benefits for the company, are (1) freeing internal IT staff, (2) gaining \\naccess to applications faster than via internal development, and (3) achieving lower-\\ncost access to corporate-quality applications. Especially appealing is the ability to gain \\naccess to large and complex systems without having to go through the expensive and \\ntime-consuming process of implementing the systems themselves in-house. Getting \\nyour computing through a cloud also makes it easier to walk away from an unsatisfac-\\ntory systems solution. Other reasons include cost effectiveness, speed to market, and \\nbetter performance (Moyle & Kelley, 2011).\\nIT managers do have some concerns about cloud computing, however. The \\nprimary concern is over security. Concerns over security are based on storing com-\\npany data on machines one does not own and that others can access. In fact, the top \\ntwo reasons for not using cloud services are concerns about unauthorized  access to \\nproprietary information and unauthorized access to customer information (Moyle & \\nKelley, 2011). Another concern is reliability. Some warn that the cloud is actually a \\nnetwork of networks, and as such, it is vulnerable to unexpected risks due to its com-\\nplexity (kfc, 2012). Still another concern is compliance with government regulations, \\nsuch as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Experts recommend a three-step process for secure \\nmigration to the cloud (Moyle & Kelley, 2011). First, have the company’s security \\nexperts involved early in the migration process, so that a vendor who understands the \\ncompany’s security and regulatory requirements can be selected. Second, set realistic \\nsecurity requirements. Make sure the requirements are clearly spelled out as part of \\nthe bidding process. Third, do an honest risk  assessment. Determine which data will \\nbe migrated and pay attention to how it will be managed by the cloud vendor. Once \\nmigration has occurred, it is important for companies to continue to monitor their \\ndata and systems and actively work with the vendor to maintain security.\\nFigure 2-4\\nA presentation edited in Google Apps \\nReprinted by permission from Joey F . \\nGeorge.'),\n",

Open-source software is different because it is freely \\navailable, not just the final product but the source code itself. It is also  different \\n because it is developed by a community of interested people instead of by  employees \\nof a particular company. Open-source software performs the same functions as \\n commercial software, such as operating systems, e-mail, database  systems, web \\nbrowsers, and so on. Some of the most well-known and popular  open-source soft-\\nware names are Linux, an operating system; mySQL, a database system; and Firefox, \\na web browser. Open source also applies to software components and  objects. Open \\nsource is  developed and maintained by communities of people, and sometimes these \\ncommunities can be very large. Developers often use common web resources, such \\nas SourceForge.net, to organize their activities. As of January 2105, SourceForge.\\nnet hosted 430,000 projects and had over 3.7 million registered users. There is no \\n question that the open-source movement would not be having the  success it enjoys \\nwithout the availability of the Internet for providing access and organizing develop-\\nment activities. \\nIf the software is free, you might wonder how anybody makes any money by \\ndeveloping open-source software. Companies and individuals can make money \\nwith open source in two primary ways: (1) by providing maintenance and other \\nservices or (2) by providing one version of the software free and selling a more\\xa0fully \\nfeatured version. Some open-source solutions have more of an impact on the soft-\\nware industry than others. Linux, for example, has been very successful in the \\nserver software market, where it is estimated to have as much as 36 percent of the \\nmarket share (W3Techs, 2015). In the desktop operating systems market, Linux \\nhas about 1 percent market share. Other open-source software products, such as \\nmySQL, have also been successful, and open source’s share of the software industry \\nseems destined to continue to grow.\\nIn-House Development  We have talked about several different types of external \\norganizations that serve as sources of software, but in-house development remains \\nan option. In-house development has become a progressively smaller piece of all sys-\\ntems development work that takes place in and for organizations. As you read earlier \\nin this chapter, internal corporate information systems departments now spend a \\nsmaller and smaller proportion of their time and effort on developing systems from \\nscratch. In-house development can lead to a larger maintenance burden than other \\ndevelopment methods, such as packaged applications. A study by Banker, Davis, and \\nSlaughter found that using a code generator as the basis for in-house development \\nwas related to an increase in maintenance hours, whereas using packaged applica-\\ntions was associated with a decrease in maintenance effort. \\nOf course, in-house development need not entail development of all of \\nthe\\xa0 software that will constitute the total system. Hybrid solutions involving \\nsome purchased and some in-house software components are common. If you \\nchoose to acquire software from outside sources, this choice is made at the end of \\nthe\\xa0analysis phase. The choice between a package and an external supplier will be \\ndetermined by your needs, not by what the supplier has to sell. As we will discuss, \\nthe results of your analysis study will define the type of product you want to buy \\nand will make working with an external supplier much easier, more productive, \\nand worthwhile. Table 2-2 compares the six different software sources discussed \\nin this section.\\nchoosing off-the-Shelf Software\\nOnce you have decided to purchase off-the-shelf software rather than write some or \\nall of the software for your new system, how do you decide what to buy? There are \\nseveral criteria to consider, and special criteria may arise with each potential software '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\ASUS\\\\Desktop\\\\AI powered chatbot\\\\Data\\\\SAD.pdf', 'page': 59}, page_content=' Chapter 2   The Origins Of sOfTware 35\\npurchase. For each criterion, an explicit comparison should be made between the \\nsoftware package and the process of developing the same application in-house. The \\nmost common criteria include the following:\\n•\\t Cost\\n•\\t Functionality\\n•\\t Vendor support\\n•\\t Viability of vendor\\n•\\t Flexibility\\n•\\t Documentation\\n•\\t Response time\\n•\\t Ease of installation\\nThese criteria are presented in no particular order. The relative importance of the \\ncriteria will vary from project to project and from organization to organization. If you \\nhad to choose two criteria that would always be among the most important, those \\ntwo would probably be vendor viability and vendor support. You do not want to get \\ninvolved with a vendor that might not be in business tomorrow. Similarly, you do not \\nwant to license software from a vendor with a reputation for poor support. How you \\nrank the importance of the remaining criteria will very much depend on the specific \\nsituation in which you find yourself.\\nCost involves comparing the cost of developing the same system in-house with \\nthe cost of purchasing or licensing the software package. You should include a com-\\nparison of the cost of purchasing vendor upgrades or annual license fees with the \\ncosts you would incur to maintain your own software. Costs for purchasing and \\n developing in-house can be compared based on economic feasibility measures (e.g., \\na present value can be calculated for the cash flow associated with each alternative).\\nFunctionality refers to the tasks the software can perform and the mandatory, \\nessential, and desired system features. Can the software package perform all or just \\nsome of the tasks your users need? If only some, can it perform the necessary core \\ntasks? Note that meeting user requirements occurs at the end of the analysis phase \\nbecause you cannot evaluate packaged software until user requirements have been \\ngathered and structured. Purchasing application software is not a substitute for con-\\nducting the systems analysis phase; rather, purchasing software is part of one design \\nstrategy for acquiring the system identified during analysis.\\nAs we said earlier, vendor support refers to whether vendor can provide support, \\nand how much it can provide. Support occurs in the form of assistance with installing \\nTable 2-2  Comparison of Six Different Sources of Software Components\\n \\nProducers\\nWhen to Go to This Type of  \\nOrganization for Software\\n \\nInternal Staffing Requirements\\nIT services firms When task requires custom support \\nand system can’t be built internally \\nor system needs to be sourced\\nInternal staff may be needed, \\ndepending on application\\nPackaged software  \\nproducers\\nWhen supported task is generic Some IS and user staff to define \\nrequirements and evaluate \\npackages\\nEnterprise-wide  \\nsolutions vendors\\nFor complete systems that cross \\nfunctional boundaries\\nSome internal staff necessary  \\nbut mostly need consultants\\nCloud computing For instant access to an application; \\nwhen supported task is generic\\nFew; frees up staff for other \\nIT\\xa0work\\nOpen-source  \\nsoftware\\nWhen supported task is generic  \\nbut cost is an issue\\nSome IS and user staff to define \\nrequirements and evaluate \\npackages\\nIn-house developers When resources and staff are \\navailable\\xa0and system must be built \\nfrom scratch\\nInternal staff necessary though \\nstaff size may vary'),\n",

Recently, many software companies have signifi-\\ncantly reduced the amount of free support they will provide customers, so the cost to \\nuse telephone, on-site, fax, or computer bulletin board support facilities should be \\nconsidered. Related to support is the vendor’s viability. You do not want to get stuck \\nwith software developed by a vendor that might go out of business soon. This latter \\npoint should not be minimized. The software industry is quite dynamic, and innova-\\ntive application software is created by entrepreneurs working from home offices—the \\nclassic cottage industry. Such organizations, even with outstanding software, often \\ndo not have the resources or business management ability to stay in business very \\nlong. Further, competitive moves by major software firms can render the products \\nof smaller firms outdated or incompatible with operating systems. One software firm \\nwe talked to while developing this book was struggling to survive just trying to make \\nits software work on any supposedly Windows PC (given the infinite combination of \\nvideo boards, monitors, BIOS chips, and other components). Keeping up with hard-\\nware and system software changes may be more than a small firm can handle, and \\ngood off-the-shelf application software can be lost.\\nFlexibility refers to how easy it is for you, or the vendor, to customize the soft-\\nware. If the software is not very flexible, your users may have to adapt the way they \\nwork to fit the software. Are they likely to adapt in this manner? Purchased software \\ncan be modified in several ways. Sometimes the vendor will be willing to make cus-\\ntom changes for you, if you are willing to pay for the redesign and programming. \\nSome vendors design the software for customization. For example, the software may \\ninclude several different ways of processing data and, at installation time, the cus-\\ntomer chooses which to initiate. Also, displays and reports may be easily redesigned \\nif these modules are written in a fourth-generation language. Reports, forms, and \\ndisplays may be easily customized using a process whereby your company name and \\nchosen titles for reports, displays, forms, column headings, and so forth are selected \\nfrom a table of parameters you provide. You may want to employ some of these same \\ncustomization techniques for systems developed in-house so that the software can be \\neasily adapted for different business units, product lines, or departments.\\nDocumentation includes the user’s manual as well as technical documentation. \\nHow understandable and up-to-date is the documentation? What is the cost for mul-\\ntiple copies, if required? Response time refers to how long it takes the software pack-\\nage to respond to the user’s requests in an interactive session. Another measure of \\ntime would be how long it takes the software to complete running a job. Finally, ease \\nof installation is a measure of the difficulty of loading the software and making it \\noperational.\\nOf course, the criteria for software acquisition will vary with the type of system \\nyou are acquiring. For example, if you are thinking about licensing an ERP system, \\nyou will certainly take all of the prior criteria into account, but you will also want to \\ninvestigate criteria that are specific to ERP systems. Verville and colleagues (2005) \\nstudied organizations that had acquired ERP systems to discover what the critical \\nfactors were for success. They found 10 success factors, with 5 related to the acquisi-\\ntion process, and 5 related to the people in the process. They found the acquisition \\nprocess had to be highly planned and structured, and it had to be rigorous. For the \\nprocess to be successful, nothing could be overlooked during planning. It was impor-\\ntant that two of the five success factors related to the process were completed before \\nERP vendors were contacted. These two factors were determining all of the system \\nrequirements and establishing the selection and evaluation criteria. These two fac-\\ntors helped the organizations compose clear descriptions of their needs and evaluate \\nbids from vendors. The fifth process-related criterion was obtaining accurate infor-\\nmation. Information sources needed to be verified and cross-validated.\\nThe other five success factors dealt with the people involved in the acquisition \\nprocess. The first factor was clear and unambiguous authority. The person in charge \\nof the process needed to be objective and a strong leader. Second, the composition '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\ASUS\\\\Desktop\\\\AI powered chatbot\\\\Data\\\\SAD.pdf', 'page': 61}, page_content=' Chapter 2   The Origins Of sOfTware 37\\nof the acquisition team was important. The team needed to be diverse, with each \\nmember having a particular skill set that was complementary to those of the other \\nteam members. Third, it was considered important to approach the relationship with \\nthe vendor as a partnership, as opposed to an adversarial or neutral relationship. \\nGiven the complexity and cost of ERP systems, members of the acquiring organiza-\\ntion would be working with the vendors for several years, so a comfortable working \\nrelationship was essential. Fourth, future users of the ERP system were active partici-\\npants in the acquisition process. Lastly, the fifth success factor related to people in \\nthe process was user buy-in. In the companies studied, user buy-in often translated \\ninto user acceptance of the system and even enthusiasm and excitement about it.\\nValidating Purchased Software information\\nOne way to get all of the information you want about a software package is to  collect it \\nfrom the vendor. Some of this information may be contained in the software documen-\\ntation and technical marketing literature. Other information can be provided upon \\n request. For example, you can send prospective vendors a questionnaire,  asking specific \\nquestions about their packages. This may be part of a request for proposal (RFP) or a \\nrequest for quote (RFQ) process your organization requires when major purchases are \\nmade. Space does not permit us to discuss the topic of RFPs and RFQs here; you may \\nwish to refer to purchasing and marketing texts if you are unfamiliar with such processes \\n(additional references about RFPs and RFQs are found at the end of this chapter).\\nThere is, of course, no replacement for actually using the software yourself \\nand running it through a series of tests based on your software selection criteria. \\nRemember to test not only the software, but also the documentation, training \\n materials, and even the technical support facilities. One requirement you can place \\non prospective software vendors as part of the bidding process is that they install \\n(free or at an agreed-upon cost) their software for a limited amount of time on your \\ncomputers. This way you can determine how their software works in your environ-\\nment, not in some optimized environment they have for demonstration purposes.\\nOne of the most reliable and insightful sources is other users of the software. \\nVendors will usually provide a list of customers (remember, they will naturally tell you \\nabout satisfied customers, so you may have to probe for a cross section of customers) \\nand people who are willing to be contacted by prospective customers. And here is \\nwhere your personal network of contacts, developed through professional groups, \\ncollege friends, trade associations, or local business clubs, can be a resource; do not \\nhesitate to find some contacts on your own. Such current or former customers can \\nprovide a depth of insight on the use of a package at their organizations.\\nTo gain a range of opinions about possible packages, you can use independent \\nsoftware testing and abstracting services that periodically evaluate software and col-\\nlect user opinions. Such surveys are available for a fee either as subscription services \\nor on demand (two popular services are Auerbach Publishers and DataPro); occa-\\nsionally, unbiased surveys appear in trade publications. Often, however, articles in \\ntrade publications, even software reviews, are actually seeded by the software manu-\\nfacturer and are not unbiased.\\nIf you are comparing several software packages, you can assign scores for each \\npackage on each criterion and compare the scores using the quantitative method we \\ndemonstrate in Chapter 4 for comparing alternative system design strategies.\\nReuSe\\nReuse is the use of previously written software resources in new applications. Because \\nso many bits and pieces of applications are relatively generic across applications, it \\nseems intuitive that great savings can be achieved in many areas if those generic \\nbits and pieces do not have to be written anew each time they are needed.

Reuse should also decrease development time, minimizing  schedule overruns. \\nBecause existing pieces of software have already been tested, reusing them should \\nalso result in higher-quality software with lower defect rates, decreasing mainte-\\nnance costs.\\nAlthough reuse can conceivably apply to many different aspects of software, \\n typically it is most commonly applied to two different development technologies: \\nobject-oriented and component-based development. You were briefly introduced to \\nobject-oriented development in Chapter 1. For example, consider an object class \\ncreated to model an employee. The object class Employee would contain both the \\ndata about employees and the instructions necessary for calculating payroll for a \\n variety of job types. The object class could be used in any application that dealt with \\n employees, but if changes had to be made in calculating payroll for different types \\nof employees, the changes would have to be made only to the object class and not to \\nthe various applications that used it. By definition, using the Employee object class in \\nmore than one application constitutes reuse.\\nComponent-based development is similar to object-oriented development in \\nthat the focus is on creating general-purpose pieces of software that can be used \\n interchangeably in many different programs. Components can be as small as objects \\nor as large as pieces of software that handle single business functions, such as cur-\\nrency conversion. The idea behind component-based development is the assembly of \\nan application from many different components at many different levels of complex-\\nity and size. Many vendors are working on developing libraries of components that \\ncan be retrieved and assembled, as needed, into desired applications.\\nSome evidence suggests that reuse can be effective, especially for object classes. \\nFor example, one laboratory study found that reuse of object class libraries resulted \\nin increased productivity, reduced defect density, and reduced rework (Basili et al., \\n1996). For HP, a reuse program resulted in cutting time to market for certain prod-\\nucts by a factor of three or more, from 18 months to less than 5 months (Griss, \\n2003). However, for reuse to work in an organizational setting, many different issues \\nmust be addressed. Technical issues include the current lack of a methodology for \\ncreating and clearly defining and labeling reusable components for placement in a \\nlibrary, and the small number of reusable and reliable software resources currently \\navailable. Key organizational issues include the lack of commitment to reuse, as well \\nas the lack of proper training and rewards needed to promote it, the lack of organi-\\nzational support for institutionalizing reuse, and the difficulty in measuring the eco-\\nnomic gains from reuse. Royce (1998) argues that, due to the considerable costs of \\ndeveloping a reusable component, most organizations cannot compete economically \\nwith established commercial organizations that focus on selling components as their \\nmain line of business. Success depends on being able to leverage the cost of compo-\\nnents across a large user and project base (Figure 2-5). There are also key legal and \\ncontractual issues concerning the reuse of object classes and components originally \\nused in other applications (Kim and Stohr, 1998).\\nWhen an organization’s management decides to pursue reuse as a strategy, it is \\nimportant for the organization to match its approach to reuse with its strategic busi-\\nness goals (Griss, 2003). The benefits of reuse grow as more corporate experience is \\ngained from it, but so do the costs and the amount of resources necessary for reuse \\nto work well. Software reuse has three basic steps: abstraction, storage, and recontex-\\ntualization (Grinter, 2001). Abstraction involves the design of a reusable piece of soft-\\nware, starting from existing software assets or from scratch. Storage involves making \\nsoftware assets available for others to use. Although it sounds like a simple problem, \\nstorage can actually be very challenging. The problem is not simply putting software \\nassets on a shelf; the problem is correctly labeling and cataloging assets so that  others \\ncan find the ones they want to use. Once an asset has been found, recontextualiza-\\ntion becomes important. This involves making the reusable asset understandable to '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\ASUS\\\\Desktop\\\\AI powered chatbot\\\\Data\\\\SAD.pdf', 'page': 63}, page_content=' Chapter 2   The Origins Of sOfTware 39\\ndevelopers who want to use it in their systems. Software is complex, and a software \\nasset developed for a particular system under system-specific circumstances may not at \\nall be the asset it appears to be. What appears to be a generic asset called “customer” \\nmay actually be something quite different, depending on the context in which it was \\ndeveloped. It may often appear to be easier to simply build your own  assets rather \\nthan invest the time and energy it takes to establish a good understanding of software \\nsomeone else has developed. A key part of a reuse strategy, as mentioned previously, \\nis establishing rewards, incentives, and organizational support for reuse to help make \\nit more worthwhile than developing your own assets.\\nAccording to Griss (2003), an organization can take one of four approaches \\nto reuse (Table 2-3). The ad hoc approach to reuse is not really an approach at \\nall, at least from an official organizational perspective. With this approach, indi-\\nviduals are free to find or develop reusable assets on their own, and there are few, \\nif any, organizational rewards for reusing assets. Storage is not an issue, because \\n individuals keep track of and distribute their own software assets. For such an ad \\nhoc, individually driven approach, it is difficult to measure any potential benefits \\nto the company.\\nAnother approach to reuse is facilitated reuse. With this approach, developers are \\nnot required to practice reuse, but they are encouraged to do so. The organization \\nmakes available some tools and techniques that enable the development and sharing \\nDevelopment\\nCost and\\nSchedule\\nResources\\nNumber of Projects Using Reusable Assets\\nMany-project solution: High value per unit investment\\n5-project solution: 125% more cost and\\n150% more time\\n2-project solution: 50% more cost and 100% more time\\n1-project solution\\nFigure 2-5\\nInvestments necessary to achieve \\nreusable components\\n(Source: Royce, Walker, Software Project \\nManagement: A Unified Framework, 1st\\xa0ed., \\n©1998.

Very little is done to track the  quality and use \\nof reusable assets, however, and the overall corporate investment is small.\\nManaged reuse is a more structured, and more expensive, mode of managing \\nsoftware reuse. With managed reuse, the development, sharing, and adoption of \\n reusable assets is mandated. The organization establishes processes and policies for \\nensuring that reuse is practiced and that the results are measured. The organization \\nalso establishes policies and procedures for ensuring the quality of its reusable assets. \\nThe focus is on identifying existing assets that can be potentially reused from various \\nsources, including from utility asset libraries that come with operating systems, from \\ncompanies that sell assets, from the open-source community, from internal reposito-\\nries, from scouring existing legacy code, and so on.\\nThe most expensive and extensive approach to reuse is designed reuse. In  addition \\nto mandating reuse and measuring its effectiveness, the designed reuse  approach \\ntakes the extra step of mandating that assets be designed for reuse as they are being \\ndesigned for specific applications. The focus is more on developing reusable assets \\nthan on finding existing assets that might be candidates for reuse. A corporate reuse \\noffice may be established to monitor and manage the overall methodology. Under \\nsuch an approach, as much as 90 percent of software assets may be reused across dif-\\nferent applications.\\nEach approach to reuse has its advantages and disadvantages. No single \\n approach is a silver bullet that will solve the reuse puzzle for all organizations and \\nfor all situations. Successful reuse requires an understanding of how reuse fits within \\nlarger organizational goals and strategies, as well as an understanding of the social \\nand technical world into which the reusable assets must fit.\\nSummary\\nAs a systems analyst, you must be aware of where you can \\nobtain software that meets some or all of an organization’s \\nneeds. You can obtain application (and system) software \\nfrom information technology services firms, packaged \\nsoftware providers, vendors of enterprise-wide solution \\nsoftware, cloud computing vendors, and open-source soft-\\nware providers, as well as from internal systems develop-\\nment resources, including the reuse of existing software \\ncomponents. You can even hire an organization to handle \\nall of your systems development needs, which is called \\noutsourcing.

He couldn’t \\nbelieve that he was the assistant director of information \\ntechnology at Petrie Electronics, his favorite consumer \\nelectronics retail store. He always bought his new DVDs \\nand video games for his Xbox 360 at Petrie. In fact, he \\nbought his Blu-ray player and his Xbox 360 at Petrie, \\nalong with his surround sound system and his 40-inch flat-\\nscreen HD LED TV. And now he worked there, too. The \\nemployee discount was a nice perk1 of his new job, but \\nhe was also glad that his technical and people skills were \\nfinally recognized by the people at Petrie. He worked \\nfor five years at Broadway Entertainment Company as a \\n senior systems analyst, and it was clear that he was not \\ngoing to be promoted there. He was really glad he posted \\nhis résumé on Monster.com and that now he had a bigger \\nsalary and a great job with more responsibility at Petrie.\\nPetrie Electronics started as a single electronics store \\nin 1984 in San Diego, California. The store was started by \\n Jacob Rosenstein in a strip mall. It was named after Rob \\nPetrie, the TV writer played by Dick Van Dyke in the TV \\nshow of the same name. Rosenstein always liked that show. \\nWhen he had grown the store to a chain of 13 locations in \\nthe Southern California area, the business became too much \\nfor Rosenstein to handle. He sold out in 1992, for a hand-\\nsome profit, to the Matsutoya Corporation, a huge Japanese \\nconglomerate that saw the chain of stores as a place to sell \\nits many consumer electronics goods in the United States.\\nMatsutoya aggressively expanded the chain to 218 \\nstores nationwide by the time they sold it in 2002, for a \\nhandsome profit, to Sam and Harry’s, a maker and seller \\nof ice cream. Sam and Harry’s was looking for a way to \\n diversify and invest the considerable cash they made \\ncreating and selling ice cream, with flavors named after \\n actors and actresses, like their best-selling Lime Neeson \\nand Jim Carrey-mel. Sam and Harry’s brought in pro-\\nfessional management to run the chain, and since they \\nbought it, they had added 15 more stores, including 1 \\nin Mexico and 3 in Canada. Even though they originally \\nwanted to move the headquarters to their home-base state \\nof Delaware, Sam and Harry decided to keep Petrie head-\\nquartered in San Diego.\\nThe company had made some smart moves and had done \\nwell, Jim knew, but he also knew that competition was \\nfierce. Petrie competitors included big electronics retail \\nchains like BestBuy. In California, Fry’s was a  ferocious \\ncompetitor. Other major players in the arena included the \\nelectronics departments of huge chains like Walmart and \\nTarget and online vendors like Amazon.com.

In this chapter, \\nwe focus on the systems analyst’s role as project man-\\nager of an information systems project. Throughout the \\nSDLC, the project manager is responsible for initiat-\\ning, planning, executing, and closing down the systems \\n development project. Project management is arguably \\nthe most important aspect of an information systems \\n development project. Effective project management \\nhelps to ensure that systems development projects meet \\ncustomer expectations and are delivered within budget \\nand time constraints.\\nToday, there is a shift in the types of projects most \\nfirms are undertaking, which makes project manage-\\nment much more difficult and even more critical to \\nproject success (Fuller et al., 2008; Schiff, 2014a). For ex-\\nample, in the past, organizations focused much of their \\ndevelopment on very large, custom-designed, stand-alone \\napplications. Today, much of the systems development ef-\\nfort in organizations focuses on implementing packaged \\nsoftware such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) \\nand data warehousing systems. Existing legacy applica-\\ntions are also being modified so that business-to-business \\ntransactions can occur seamlessly over the Internet. New \\nweb-based interfaces are being added to existing legacy \\nsystems so that a broader range of users, often distributed \\nglobally, can access corporate information and systems. \\nAdditionally, software developed by global outsourcing \\npartners that must be integrated into an organization’s \\nexisting portfolio of applications is now common practice \\n(Overby, 2013). Working with vendors to supply applica-\\ntions, with customers or suppliers to integrate systems, or \\nwith a broader and more diverse user community requires \\nthat project managers be highly skilled. Consequently, it is \\nimportant that you gain an understanding of the project \\nmanagement process; this will become a critical skill for \\nyour future success.\\nIn this chapter, we focus on the systems analyst’s role \\nin managing information systems projects and will refer \\nto this role as the project manager. The first section will \\nprovide the background for Pine Valley Furniture (PVF), \\na manufacturing company that we will visit throughout \\nthe remainder of the book. We will then provide you with \\nan understanding of the project manager’s role and the \\nproject management process. The discussion then turns \\nto techniques for reporting project plans using Gantt \\ncharts and network diagrams.

In the early 1980s, PVF’s \\nfounder, Alex Schuster, started to make and sell custom furniture in his garage. Alex \\nmanaged invoices and kept track of customers by using file folders and a filing cabi-\\nnet. By 1984, business expanded and Alex had to rent a warehouse and hire a part-\\ntime bookkeeper. PVF’s product line had multiplied, sales volume had doubled, and \\nstaff had increased to 50 employees. By 1990, PVF moved into its third and present \\nlocation. Due to the added complexity of the company’s operations, Alex reorga-\\nnized the company into the following functional areas:\\n•\\t Manufacturing, which was further subdivided into three separate functions—\\nFabrication, Assembling, and Finishing\\n•\\t Sales\\n•\\t Orders\\n•\\t Accounting\\n•\\t Purchasing\\nAlex and the heads of the functional areas established manual information \\nsystems, such as accounting ledgers and file folders, which worked well for a time. \\nEventually, however, PVF selected and installed a network server to automate invoic-\\ning, accounts receivable, and inventory control applications.\\nWhen the applications were first computerized, each separate application had \\nits own individual data files tailored to the needs of each functional area. As is typical \\nin such situations, the applications closely resembled the manual systems on which \\nthey were based. Three computer applications at PVF are depicted in Figure 3-1: \\norder filling, invoicing, and payroll. In the late 1990s, PVF formed a task force to study \\nthe possibility of moving to a database approach. After a preliminary study, manage-\\nment decided to convert its information systems to such an approach. The company \\nupgraded its network server and implemented a centralized database management \\nsystem. Today, PVF has successfully deployed an integrated, company-wide database \\nand has converted its applications to work with the database. However, PVF is continu-\\ning to grow at a rapid rate, putting pressure on its current application systems.\\nThe computer-based applications at PVF support its business processes.

Employees have to be paid for their work. Given these tasks, most of \\nPVF’s computer-based applications are located in the accounting and financial areas. \\nThe applications include order filling, invoicing, accounts receivable, inventory con-\\ntrol, accounts payable, payroll, and general ledger. At one time, each application had \\nits own data files. For example, there was a customer master file, an inventory master \\nfile, a back-order file, an inventory pricing file, and an employee master file. The \\norder filling system used data from three files: customer master, inventory master, \\nand back order. Today, however, all systems are designed and integrated through \\na company-wide database in which data are organized around entities, or subjects, \\nsuch as customers, invoices, and orders.\\nPVF, like many firms, decided to develop its application software in-house; that \\nis, it hired staff and bought the computer hardware and software necessary to build \\napplication software suited to its own needs. (Other methods used to obtain appli-\\ncation software were discussed in Chapter 2.) Although PVF continues to grow at a \\nrapid rate, market conditions are becoming extremely competitive, especially with \\nthe advent of the Internet and the web. Let’s see how a project manager plays a key \\nrole in developing a new information system for PVF.\\nManagIng the InForMatIon SySteMS ProjeCt\\nProject management is an important aspect of the development of information sys-\\ntems and a critical skill for a systems analyst. The focus of project management is to \\nensure that systems development projects meet customer expectations and are deliv-\\nered within budget and time constraints.\\nThe project manager is a systems analyst with a diverse set of skills—manage-\\nment, leadership, technical, conflict management, and customer relationship—who \\nis responsible for initiating, planning, executing, and closing down a project. As a \\nproject manager, your environment is one of continual change and problem  solving. \\nIn some organizations, the project manager is a very experienced systems analyst, \\nwhereas in others, both junior and senior analysts are expected to take on this role, \\nmanaging parts of a project or actively supporting a more senior colleague who \\n assumes the project manager role. Understanding the project management process \\nis a critical skill for your future success.\\nCreating and implementing successful projects requires managing the \\n resources, activities, and tasks needed to complete the information systems project. \\nA project is a planned undertaking of a series of related activities to reach an objec-\\ntive that has a beginning and an end. The first question you might ask yourself is \\n“Where do projects come from?” and, after considering all the different things that \\nyou could be asked to work on within an organization, “How do I know which proj-\\nects to work on?” The ways in which each organization answers these questions vary.\\nIn the rest of this section, we describe the process followed by Juanita Lopez \\nand Chris Martin during the development of PVF’s Purchasing Fulfillment System. \\nJuanita works in the Order department, and Chris is a systems analyst.\\nJuanita observed problems with the way orders were processed and reported: \\nSales growth had increased the workload for the Manufacturing department, and the \\ncurrent systems no longer adequately supported the tracking of orders. It was becom-\\ning more difficult to track orders and get the right furniture and invoice to the right \\ncustomers. Juanita contacted Chris, and together they developed a system that cor-\\nrected these Order department problems.\\nThe first deliverable, or end product, produced by Chris and Juanita was a System \\nService Request (SSR), a standard form PVF uses for requesting systems development \\nwork. Figure 3-2 shows an SSR for a purchasing fulfillment system. The form includes \\nthe name and contact information of the person requesting the system, a statement of \\nthe problem, and the name and contact information of the liaison and sponsor.\\nProject manager\\nA systems analyst with a diverse set of \\nskills—management, leadership, technical, \\nconflict management, and customer \\nrelationship—who is responsible for \\ninitiating, planning, executing, and closing \\ndown a project.\\nProject\\nA planned undertaking of related activities \\nto reach an objective that has a beginning \\nand an end.\\nDeliverable\\nAn end product of an SDLC phase.'),\n",

Because \\nall organizations have limited time and resources, not all requests can be approved. \\nThe board evaluates development requests in relation to the business problems or \\nopportunities the system will solve or create; it also considers how the proposed proj-\\nect fits within the organization’s information systems architecture and long-range \\ndevelopment plans. The review board selects those projects that best meet overall or-\\nganizational objectives (we learn more about organizational objectives in Chapter 4). \\nIn the case of the Purchasing Fulfillment System request, the board found merit in \\nthe request and approved a more detailed feasibility study. A feasibility study, which \\nis conducted by the project manager, involves determining if the information system \\nmakes sense for the organization from an economic and operational standpoint. The \\nstudy takes place before the system is constructed. Figure 3-3 is a graphical view of \\nthe steps followed during the project initiation of the Purchasing Fulfillment System.\\nIn summary, systems development projects are undertaken for two primary rea-\\nsons: to take advantage of business opportunities and to solve business problems. \\nTaking advantage of an opportunity might mean providing an innovative service \\nto customers through the creation of a new system. For example, PVF may want to \\ncreate a website so that customers can easily access its catalog and place orders at any \\ntime. Solving a business problem could involve modifying the way an existing system \\nprocesses data so that more accurate or timely information is provided to users. For \\nexample, a company such as PVF may create a password-protected intranet site that \\ncontains important announcements and budget information. Of course, projects \\nare not always initiated for the aforementioned rational reasons (taking advantage \\nFeasibility study\\nA study that determines if the proposed \\ninformation system makes sense for the \\norganization from an economic and \\noperational standpoint.\\nPine Valley Furniture\\nSystem Service Request\\nREQUESTED BY\\nDEPARTMENT\\nLOCATION\\nCONTACT\\nTYPE OF REQUEST\\nPROBLEM STATEMENT\\nURGENCY\\nDATEJuanita Lopez\\nPurchasing, Manufacturing Support\\nHeadquarters, 1-322\\nTel: 4-3267     FAX: 4-3270     e-mail: jlopez\\nOctober 1, 2017\\n[\\n[\\n[\\n]\\n]\\n]\\n[\\n[\\n[\\n]\\n]\\n]\\nNew System\\nSystem Enhancement\\nSystem Error Correction\\nImmediate – Operations are impaired or \\nopportunity lost\\nProblems exist, but can be worked around\\nBusiness losses can be tolerated until new \\nsystem installed\\nX\\nX\\nSales growth at PVF has caused greater volume of work for the manufacturing support unit within Purchasing.

For example, in some in-\\nstances, organizations and government undertake projects to spend resources, to at-\\ntain or pad budgets, to keep people busy, or to help train people and develop their \\nskills. Our focus in this chapter is not on how and why organizations identify projects \\nbut on the management of projects once they have been identified.\\nOnce a potential project has been identified, an organization must determine \\nthe resources required for its completion. This is done by analyzing the scope of \\nthe project and determining the probability of successful completion. After getting \\nthis information, the organization can then determine whether taking advantage of \\nan opportunity or solving a particular problem is feasible within time and resource \\nconstraints. If deemed feasible, a more detailed project analysis is then conducted. \\nAs you will see, the ability to determine the size, scope, and resource requirements of \\na project is just one of the many skills that a project manager must possess. A project \\nmanager is often thought of as a juggler keeping aloft many balls, which reflect the \\nvarious aspects of a project’s development, as depicted in Figure 3-4.\\nTo successfully orchestrate the construction of a complex information system, a \\nproject manager must have interpersonal, leadership, and technical skills. Table 3-1 \\nlists the project manager’s common skills and activities. Note that many of the skills \\nare related to personnel or general management, not simply technical skills. Table 3-1 \\nshows that not only does an effective project manager have varied skills, but he or \\nshe is also the most instrumental person to the successful completion of any project.\\nThe remainder of this chapter will focus on the project management process, \\nwhich involves four phases:\\n1.

Depending on the project, some initiation activities may be \\nunnecessary and some may be very involved. The types of activities you will perform \\nwhen initiating a project are summarized in Figure 3-5 and described next.\\n1. Establishing the project initiation team. This activity involves organizing an initial \\ncore of project team members to assist in accomplishing the project initiation \\nactivities (Chau et al., 2012; Verma, 1996; 1997). For example, during the Pur-\\nchasing Fulfillment System project at PVF, Chris Martin was assigned to support \\nthe Purchasing department. It is a PVF policy that all initiation teams consist of at \\nleast one user representative, in this case Juanita Lopez, and one member of the \\ninformation systems (IS) development group. Therefore, the project initiation \\nteam consisted of Chris and Juanita; Chris was the project manager.\\n2. Establishing a relationship with the customer. A thorough understanding of your cus-\\ntomer builds stronger partnerships and higher levels of trust. At PVF, manage-\\nment has tried to foster strong working relationships between business units (like \\nPurchasing) and the IS development group by assigning a specific individual to \\nwork as a liaison between both groups. Because Chris had been assigned to the \\nPurchasing unit for some time, he was already aware of some of the problems \\nwith the existing purchasing systems. PVF’s policy of assigning specific individ-\\nuals to each business unit helped to ensure that both Chris and Juanita were \\ncomfortable working together prior to the initiation of the project. Many orga-\\nnizations use a similar mechanism for establishing relationships with customers.\\n3. Establishing the project initiation plan. This step defines the activities required to \\norganize the initiation team while it is working to define the goals and scope of \\nthe project (Abdel-Hamid et al., 1999). Chris’s role was to help Juanita translate \\nher business requirements into a written request for an improved information \\nsystem. This required the collection, analysis, organization, and transformation \\nof a lot of information. Because Chris and Juanita were already familiar with each \\nother and their roles within a development project, they next needed to define \\nwhen and how they would communicate, define deliverables and project steps, \\nand set deadlines. Their initiation plan included agendas for several meetings. \\nThese steps eventually led to the creation of their SSR form.\\n4. Establishing management procedures. Successful projects require the development of \\neffective management procedures. Within PVF, many of these management pro-\\ncedures had been established as standard operating procedures by the Systems \\nPriority Board and the IS development group. For example, all project develop-\\nment work is charged back to the functional unit requesting the work. In other or-\\nganizations, each project may have unique procedures tailored to its needs. Yet, in \\ngeneral, when establishing procedures, you are concerned with developing team \\ncommunication and reporting procedures, job assignments and roles, project \\nProject initiation\\nThe first phase of the project management \\nprocess in which activities are performed to \\nassess the size, scope, and complexity of \\nthe project and to establish procedures to \\nsupport later project activities.\\nProject Initiation\\n1.

It was fortunate for Chris and Juanita that most of these procedures were \\nalready established at PVF, allowing them to move on to other project activities.\\n5. Establishing the project management environment and project workbook. The focus of \\nthis activity is to collect and organize the tools that you will use while managing \\nthe project and to construct the project workbook. Diagrams, charts, and system \\ndescriptions provide much of the project workbook contents. Thus, the project \\nworkbook serves as a repository for all project correspondence, inputs, outputs, \\ndeliverables, procedures, and standards established by the project team (Rettig, \\n1990; Dinsmore and Cabanis-Brewin, 2006). The project workbook can be stored \\nas an online electronic document or in a large three-ring binder. The project \\nworkbook is used by all team members and is useful for project audits, orienta -\\ntion of new team members, communication with management and customers, \\nidentifying future projects, and performing post-project reviews. The establish -\\nment of a workbook and the diligent recording of all project information are two \\nof the most important activities you will perform as project manager.\\nFigure 3-6 shows the project workbook for the Purchasing Fulfillment Sys -\\ntem on the PVF intranet. Keeping the project workbook online has many advan -\\ntages for keeping the project team on track and efficient. Online documents can \\nbe easily accessed by all team members. Additionally, everyone is always working \\nwith the most up-to-date information. The best feature of using the web as your \\nrepository is that it enables project members and customers to review a project’s \\nstatus and all related information continually.\\n6. Developing the project charter. The project charter  is a short (typically one page), \\nhigh-level document prepared for the customer that describes what the project \\nwill deliver and outlines many of the key elements of the project. A project \\ncharter can vary in the amount of detail it contains, but it often includes the \\nfollowing elements:\\n•\\t Project title and date of authorization\\n•\\t Project manager name and contact information\\nProject workbook\\nAn online or hard-copy repository for all \\nproject correspondence, inputs, outputs, \\ndeliverables, procedures, and standards \\nthat is used for performing project \\naudits, orienting new team members, \\ncommunicating with management and \\ncustomers, identifying future projects, and \\nperforming post-project reviews.\\nProject charter\\nA short document prepared for the \\ncustomer during project initiation that \\ndescribes what the project will deliver and \\noutlines generally at a high level all work \\nrequired to complete the project.\\nPine Valley Furniture\\nInformation Systems Development Group\\nProject: Purchasing Fulﬁllment System\\n1.\\n2.\\n3.\\n4.\\n5.\\n6.\\n7.\\n8.\\n9.\\nProject overview\\nInitiation plan and SSR\\nProject scope and risks\\nManagement procedures\\nData descriptions\\nProcess descriptions\\nTeam correspondence\\nProject charter\\nProject schedule\\nLogged in: Chris Martin\\nFIGURE 3-6 \\nThe project workbook for the Purchasing \\nFulfillment System project contains nine \\nkey elements\\nSource: A-R-T/Shutterstock'),\n",

A sample project charter is shown in Figure 3-7.\\nProject initiation is complete once these six activities have been performed. \\nBefore moving on to the next phase of the project, the work performed during \\n project initiation is reviewed at a meeting attended by management, customers, and \\nproject team members.

In the case of the Purchasing Fulfillment System project at \\nPVF, the board accepted the SSR and selected a project steering committee to moni-\\ntor project progress and to provide guidance to the team members during subsequent \\n activities. If the scope of the project is modified, it may be necessary to return to project \\ninitiation activities and collect additional information. Once a decision is made to con-\\ntinue the project, a much more detailed project plan is developed during the project  \\nplanning phase.\\nPlanning the Project\\nThe next step in the project management process is project planning. Research has \\nfound a positive relationship between effective project planning and positive project \\noutcomes (Guinan et al., 1998; Kirsch, 2000). Project planning involves defining \\nclear, discrete activities and the work needed to complete each activity within a sin-\\ngle project. It often requires you to make numerous assumptions about the availabil-\\nity of resources such as hardware, software, and personnel. It is much easier to plan \\nnearer-term activities than those occurring in the future. In actual fact, you often \\nhave to construct longer-term plans that are more general in scope and nearer-term \\nplans that are more detailed. The repetitive nature of the project management pro-\\ncess requires that plans be constantly monitored throughout the project and period-\\nically updated (usually after each phase), based upon the most recent information.\\nFigure 3-8 illustrates the principle that nearer-term plans are typically more \\nspecific and firmer than longer-term plans. For example, it is virtually impossible to \\nrigorously plan activities late in the project without first completing the earlier activi-\\nties. Also, the outcome of activities performed earlier in the project is likely to affect \\nlater activities. This means that it is very difficult, and very likely inefficient, to try to \\nplan detailed solutions for activities that will occur far into the future.\\nAs with the project initiation process, varied and numerous activities must be \\nperformed during project planning. For example, during the Purchasing Fulfillment \\nSystem project, Chris and Juanita developed a 10-page plan. However, project plans \\nfor very large systems may be several hundred pages in length. The types of activities \\nthat you can perform during project planning are summarized in Figure 3-9 and are \\ndescribed in the following list:\\n1. Describing project scope, alternatives, and feasibility. The purpose of this activity \\nis to understand the content and complexity of the project. Within PVF’s sys -\\ntems development methodology, one of the first meetings must focus on defin-\\ning a project’s scope. Although project scope information was not included in \\nthe SSR developed by Chris and Juanita, it was important that both shared the \\nProject planning\\nThe second phase of the project \\nmanagement process that focuses on \\ndefining clear, discrete activities and the \\nwork needed to complete each activity \\nwithin a single project.\\n1 Week\\nOut\\nLow\\nMedium\\nHigh\\n1 Month\\nOut\\n6 Months\\nOut\\nPlanning Horizon\\nPlanning Detail\\nFIGURE 3-8 \\nLevel of project planning detail should be \\nhigh in the short term, with less detail as \\ntime goes on'),\n",

During this activity, you \\nshould reach agreement on the following questions:\\n•\\t What problem or opportunity does the project address?\\n•\\t What are the quantifiable results to be achieved?\\n•\\t What needs to be done?\\n•\\t How will success be measured?\\n•\\t How will we know when we are finished?\\nAfter defining the scope of the project, your next objective is to identify \\nand document general alternative solutions for the current business problem or \\nopportunity. You must then assess the feasibility of each alternative solution and \\nchoose which to consider during subsequent SDLC phases. In some instances, \\noff-the-shelf software can be found. It is also important that any unique prob-\\nlems, constraints, and assumptions about the project be clearly stated.\\n2. Dividing the project into manageable tasks. This is a critical activity during the proj-\\nect planning process. Here, you must divide the entire project into manageable \\ntasks and then logically order them to ensure a smooth evolution between tasks. \\nThe definition of tasks and their sequence is referred to as the work breakdown \\nstructure (PMBOK, 2013; Project Management Institute, 2002). Some tasks may \\nbe performed in parallel, whereas others must follow one another sequentially. \\nTask sequence depends on which tasks produce deliverables needed in other \\ntasks, when critical resources are available, the constraints placed on the project \\nby the client, and the process outlined in the SDLC.\\nFor example, suppose that you are working on a new development project \\nand need to collect system requirements by interviewing users of the new system \\nand reviewing reports they currently use to do their job. A work breakdown for \\nthese activities is represented in a Gantt chart in Figure 3-10. A Gantt chart is a \\ngraphical representation of a project that shows each task as a horizontal bar \\nwhose length is proportional to its time for completion. Different colors, shades, \\nor shapes can be used to highlight each kind of task. For example, those ac-\\ntivities on the critical path (defined later) may be in red and a summary task \\ncould have a special bar. Note that the black horizontal bars—rows 1, 2, and 6 in \\nFigure 3-10—represent summary tasks. Planned versus actual times or progress \\nfor an activity can be compared by parallel bars of different colors, shades, or \\nshapes. Gantt charts do not (typically) show how tasks must be ordered (prece-\\ndence), but simply show when an activity should begin and end. In Figure 3-10, \\nthe task duration is shown in the second column by days, “d,” and necessary prior \\nWork breakdown structure\\nThe process of dividing the project into \\nmanageable tasks and logically ordering \\nthem to ensure a smooth evolution between \\ntasks.\\nGantt chart\\nA graphical representation of a project \\nthat shows each task as a horizontal bar \\nwhose length is proportional to its time for \\ncompletion.\\nProject Planning\\n1.

Most project management \\nsoftware tools support a broad range of task durations, including minutes, hours, \\ndays, weeks, and months. As you will learn in later chapters, the SDLC consists of \\nseveral phases that you will need to break down into activities. Creating a work \\nbreakdown structure requires that you decompose phases into activities—sum -\\nmary tasks—and activities into specific tasks. For example, Figure 3-10 shows that \\nthe activity Interviewing consists of three tasks: design interview form, schedule \\nappointments, and conduct interviews.\\nDefining tasks in too much detail will make the management of the project un-\\nnecessarily complex. You will develop the skill of discovering the optimal level of de-\\ntail for representing tasks through experience. For example, it may be very difficult \\nto list tasks that require less than one hour of time to complete in a final work break-\\ndown structure. Alternatively, choosing tasks that are too large in scope (e.g., several \\nweeks long) will not provide you with a clear sense of the status of the project or of \\nthe interdependencies between tasks. What are the characteristics of a “task”? A task\\n•\\t can be done by one person or a well-defined group,\\n•\\t has a single and identifiable deliverable (the task is, however, the process of \\ncreating the deliverable),\\n•\\t has a known method or technique,\\n•\\t has well-accepted predecessor and successor steps, and\\n•\\t is measurable so that the percentage completed can be determined.\\n3. Estimating resources and creating a resource plan. The goal of this activity is to estimate \\nresource requirements for each project activity and to use this information to cre-\\nate a project resource plan. The resource plan helps assemble and deploy resources \\nin the most effective manner. For example, you would not want to bring additional \\nprogrammers onto the project at a rate faster than you could prepare work for them. \\nProject managers use a variety of tools to assist in making estimates of project size \\nand costs. The most widely used method is called COCOMO (COnstructive COst \\nMOdel), which uses parameters that were derived from prior projects of differing \\ncomplexity (Boehm et al., 2000). COCOMO uses these different parameters to pre-\\ndict human resource requirements for basic, intermediate, and very complex systems.\\nPeople are the most important, and expensive, part of project resource \\nplanning. Project time estimates for task completion and overall system quality \\nare significantly influenced by the assignment of people to tasks. It is important \\nto give people tasks that allow them to learn new skills. It is equally important \\nto make sure that project members are not “in over their heads” or working on \\na task that is not well suited to their skills. Resource estimates may need to be \\nrevised based upon the skills of the actual person (or people) assigned to a par -\\nticular activity. Figure 3-11 indicates the relative programming speed versus the \\nCOCOMO\\nThe Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO) \\nis an automated software estimation model \\nthat uses historical project data and current \\nas well as future project characteristics to \\nestimate project costs.\\nFIGURE 3-10 \\nGantt chart showing project tasks, \\nduration times for those tasks, and \\npredecessors\\n(Source: Microsoft Corporation.)'),\n",

The figure suggests that \\nCarl should not be assigned tasks in which completion time is critical and that \\nBrenda should be assigned tasks in which high quality is most vital.\\nOne approach to assigning tasks is to assign a single task type (or only a few \\ntask types) to each worker for the duration of the project. For example, you could \\nassign one worker to create all computer displays and another to create all system \\nreports. Such specialization ensures that both workers become efficient at their \\nown particular tasks. A worker may become bored if the task is too specialized or \\nis long in duration, so you could assign workers to a wider variety of tasks. How -\\never, this approach may lead to lowered task efficiency. A middle ground would be \\nto make assignments with a balance of both specialization and task variety. Assign-\\nments depend on the size of the development project and the skills of the project \\nteam. Regardless of the manner in which you assign tasks, make sure that each \\nteam member works only on one task at a time. Exceptions to this rule can occur \\nwhen a task occupies only a small portion of a team member’s time (e.g., testing \\nthe programs developed by another team member) or during an emergency.\\n4. Developing a preliminary schedule. During this activity, you use the information on \\ntasks and resource availability to assign time estimates to each activity in the work \\nbreakdown structure. These time estimates will enable you to create target start -\\ning and ending dates for the project. Target dates can be revisited and modified \\nuntil a schedule is produced that is acceptable to the customer. Determining an \\nacceptable schedule may require that you find additional or different resources \\nor that the scope of the project be changed. The schedule may be represented as \\na Gantt chart, as illustrated in Figure 3-10, or as a network diagram, as illustrated \\nin Figure 3-12. A network diagram  is a graphical depiction of project tasks and \\nNetwork diagram\\nA diagram that depicts project tasks and \\ntheir interrelationships.\\nLow\\nHigh\\nTime of Programming a Task\\nBrenda\\nAdam\\nCarl\\nQuality of Work\\nLongShort\\nFIGURE 3-11 \\nTrade-offs between the quality of the \\nprogram code versus the speed of \\nprogramming\\nFIGURE 3-12 \\nA network diagram illustrates tasks with \\nrectangles (or ovals) and the relationships \\nand sequences of those activities with \\narrows\\n(Source: Microsoft Corporation.)'),\n",

As with a Gantt chart, each type of task can be high-\\nlighted by different features on the network diagram. The distinguishing feature \\nof a network diagram is that the ordering of tasks is shown by connecting tasks—\\ndepicted as rectangles or ovals—with their predecessor and successor tasks. However, \\nthe relative size of a node (representing a task) or a gap between nodes does not \\nimply the task’s duration. Only the individual task items are drawn on a network dia-\\ngram, which is why the summary tasks 1, 2, and 6—the black bars—from Figure 3-10 \\nare not shown in Figure 3-12. We describe both of these charts later in this chapter.\\n5. Developing a communication plan. The goal of this activity is to outline the communi-\\ncation procedures among management, project team members, and the customer. \\nThe communication plan includes when and how written and oral reports will be \\nprovided by the team, how team members will coordinate work, what messages will \\nbe sent to announce the project to interested parties, and what kinds of informa-\\ntion will be shared with vendors and external contractors involved with the project. \\nIt is important that free and open communication occur among all parties with re-\\nspect to proprietary information and confidentiality with the customer (Fuller et al., \\n2008; Kettelhut, 1991; Kirsch, 2000; Vaidyanathan, 2013;Verma, 1996). When de-\\nveloping a communication plan, numerous questions must be answered in order \\nto assure that the plan is comprehensive and complete, including the following:\\n•\\t Who are the stakeholders for this project?\\n•\\t What information does each stakeholder need?\\n•\\t When, and at what interval, does this information need to be produced?\\n•\\t What sources will be used to gather and generate this information?\\n•\\t Who will collect, store, and verify the accuracy of this information?\\n•\\t Who will organize and package this information into a document?\\n•\\t Who will be the contact person for each stakeholder should any questions arise?\\n•\\t What format will be used to package this information?\\n•\\t What communication medium will be most effective for delivering this infor -\\nmation to the stakeholder?\\nOnce these questions are answered for each stakeholder, a comprehensive \\ncommunication plan can be developed. In this plan, a summary of communica-\\ntion documents, work assignments, schedules, and distribution methods will be \\noutlined. Additionally, a project communication matrix can be developed that \\nprovides a summary of the overall communication plan (see Figure 3-13). This \\nmatrix can be easily shared among team members, and verified by stakeholders \\noutside the project team, so that the right people are getting the right informa-\\ntion at the right time, and in the right format.\\n6. Determining project standards and procedures. During this activity, you will spec-\\nify how various deliverables are produced and tested by you and your project \\nteam. For example, the team must decide which tools to use, how the standard \\nSDLC might be modified, which SDLC methods will be used, documentation \\nstyles (e.g., type fonts and margins for user manuals), how team members will re-\\nport the status of their assigned activities, and terminology. Setting project stan-\\ndards and procedures for work acceptance is a way to ensure the development \\nof a high-quality system. Also, it is much easier to train new team members when \\nclear standards are in place. Organizational standards for project management \\nand conduct make the determination of individual project standards easier and \\nthe interchange or sharing of personnel among different projects feasible.\\n7. Identifying and assessing risk. The goal of this activity is to identify sources of \\nproject risk and estimate the consequences of those risks (Wideman, 1992). \\nRisks might arise from the use of new technology, prospective users’ resistance \\nto change, availability of critical resources, competitive reactions or changes in \\nregulatory actions due to the construction of a system, or team member inexperi-\\nence with technology or the business area. You should continually try to identify \\nand assess project risk.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\ASUS\\\\Desktop\\\\AI powered chatbot\\\\Data\\\\SAD.pdf', 'page': 82}, page_content='58 part I   foundationS for SySteMS develoPMent\\nThe identification of project risk is required to develop PVF’s new Purchas-\\ning Fulfillment System. Chris and Juanita met to identify and describe possible \\nnegative outcomes of the project and their probabilities of occurrence. Although \\nwe list the identification of risks and the outline of project scope as two discrete \\nactivities, they are highly related and often concurrently discussed.\\n8. Creating a preliminary budget. During this phase, you need to create a preliminary \\nbudget that outlines the planned expenses and revenues associated with your \\nproject. The project justification will demonstrate that the benefits are worth \\nthese costs. Figure 3-14 shows a cost-benefit analysis for a new development proj-\\nect. This analysis shows net present value calculations of the project’s benefits \\nand costs as well as a return on investment and cash flow analysis. We discuss \\nproject budgets fully in Chapter 5.\\n9. Developing a Project Scope Statement. An important activity that occurs near the end \\nof the project planning phase is the development of the Project Scope Statement. \\n Developed primarily for the customer, this document outlines work that will be done \\nand clearly describes what the project will deliver. The Project Scope Statement is \\nuseful to make sure that you, the customer, and other project team members have a \\nclear understanding of the intended project size, duration, and outcomes.\\n10. Setting a Baseline Project Plan. Once all of the prior project planning activities have \\nbeen completed, you will be able to develop a Baseline Project Plan. This baseline \\nplan provides an estimate of the project’s tasks and resource requirements and is \\nused to guide the next project phase—execution. As new information is acquired \\nduring project execution, the baseline plan will continue to be updated.\\nAt the end of the project planning phase, a review of the Baseline Project Plan \\nis conducted to double-check all information in the plan. As with the project initia-\\ntion phase, it may be necessary to modify the plan, which means returning to prior \\nproject planning activities before proceeding. As with the Purchasing Fulfillment \\nSystem project, you may submit the plan and make a brief presentation to the project \\nsteering committee at this time.

These \\nactivities are summarized in Figure 3-15 and described in the remainder of this \\nsection:\\n1. Executing the Baseline Project Plan. As project manager, you oversee the execution \\nof the baseline plan. This means that you initiate the execution of project ac -\\ntivities, acquire and assign resources, orient and train new team members, keep \\nthe project on schedule, and ensure the quality of project deliverables. This is a \\nformidable task, but a task made much easier through the use of sound project \\nmanagement techniques. For example, as tasks are completed during a project, \\nthey can be “marked” as completed on the project schedule. In Figure 3-16, tasks \\n3 and 7 are marked as completed by showing 100 percent in the “% Complete” \\ncolumn; task 8 is marked as being partially completed. Members of the project \\nteam will come and go. You are responsible for initiating new team members by \\nproviding them with the resources they need and helping them assimilate into \\nthe team. You may want to plan social events, regular team project status meet-\\nings, team-level reviews of project deliverables, and other group events to mold \\nthe group into an effective team.\\nFIGURE 3-14 \\nA financial cost and benefit analysis for \\na systems development project\\n(Source: Microsoft Corporation.)\\nProject Execution\\n1.

Monitoring project progress against the Baseline Project Plan. While you execute the \\nBaseline Project Plan, you should monitor your progress. If the project gets \\nahead of (or behind) schedule, you may have to adjust resources, activities, and \\nbudgets. Monitoring project activities can result in modifications to the current \\nplan. Measuring the time and effort expended on each activity will help you im -\\nprove the accuracy of estimations for future projects. It is possible, with project \\nschedule charts such as Gantt charts, to show progress against a plan, and it is \\neasy with network diagrams to understand the ramifications of delays in an ac -\\ntivity. Monitoring progress also means that the team leader must evaluate and \\nappraise each team member, occasionally change work assignments or request \\nchanges in personnel, and provide feedback to the employee’s supervisor.\\n3. Managing changes to the Baseline Project Plan. You will encounter pressure to make \\nchanges to the baseline plan. At PVF, policies dictate that only approved changes \\nto the project specification can be made and all changes must be reflected in the \\nbaseline plan and project workbook, including all charts. For example, if Juanita \\nsuggests a significant change to the existing design of the Purchasing Fulfillment \\nSystem, a formal change request must be approved by the steering committee. \\nThe request should explain why changes are desired and describe all possible ef-\\nfects on prior and subsequent activities, project resources, and the overall project \\nschedule. Chris would have to help Juanita develop such a request. This informa-\\ntion allows the project steering committee to more easily evaluate the costs and \\nbenefits of a significant midcourse change.\\nIn addition to changes occurring through formal request, changes may also \\noccur from events outside your control. In fact, numerous events may initiate a \\nchange to the Baseline Project Plan, including the following possibilities:\\n•\\t A slipped completion date for an activity\\n•\\t A bungled activity that must be redone\\n•\\t The identification of a new activity that becomes evident later in the project\\n•\\t An unforeseen change in personnel due to sickness, resignation, or \\ntermination\\nWhen an event occurs that delays the completion of an activity, you typi -\\ncally have two choices: devise a way to get back on schedule or revise the plan. \\nDevising a way to get back on schedule is the preferred approach because no \\nchanges to the plan will have to be made. The ability to head off and smoothly \\nwork around problems is a critical skill that you need to master.\\nAs you will see later in this chapter, project schedule charts are very helpful \\nin assessing the impact of change. Using such charts, you can quickly see if the \\ncompletion time of other activities will be affected by changes in the duration of \\nFIGURE 3-16 \\nGantt chart with tasks 3 and 7 \\ncompleted, and task 8 partially \\ncompleted\\n(Source: Microsoft Corporation.)'),\n",

Often you \\nwill have to find a way to rearrange the activities because the ultimate project \\ncompletion date may be rather fixed. There may be a penalty to the organization \\n(even legal action) if the expected completion date is not met.\\n4. Maintaining the project workbook. As in all project phases, maintaining complete \\nrecords of all project events is necessary. The workbook provides the documen -\\ntation new team members require to assimilate project tasks quickly. It explains \\nwhy design decisions were made and is a primary source of information for pro-\\nducing all project reports.\\n5. Communicating the project status. The project manager is responsible for keeping \\nall stakeholders—system developers, managers, and customers—abreast of the \\nproject status. In other words, communicating the project status focuses on the \\nexecution of the project communication plan and the response to any ad hoc in-\\nformation requests by stakeholders. A broad variety of methods can be used to \\ndistribute information, each with strengths and weaknesses. Some methods are \\neasier for the information sender, but more difficult or less convenient for the \\nreceiver. With the maturing digital networks and the Internet, more and more \\ndigital communication is being exchanged. Procedures for communicating proj-\\nect activities vary from formal meetings to informal hallway discussions. Some \\nprocedures are useful for informing others of the project’s status, others are bet-\\nter for resolving issues, and still others are better for keeping permanent records \\nof information and events. Two types of information are routinely exchanged \\nthroughout the project: work results—the outcomes of the various tasks and activi-\\nties that are performed to complete the project—and the project plan—the formal \\ncomprehensive document that is used to execute the project; it contains numer-\\nous items including the project charter, project schedule, budgets, and risk plan. \\nTable 3-2 lists numerous communication procedures, their level of formality, and \\ntheir most likely use. Whichever procedure you use, frequent communication \\nhelps to ensure project success (Kettelhut, 1991; Kirsch, 2000; Verma, 1996).\\nThis section outlined your role as the project manager during the execution of \\nthe Baseline Project Plan. The ease with which the project can be managed is signifi-\\ncantly influenced by the quality of prior project phases. If you develop a high-quality \\nproject plan, it is much more likely that the project will be successfully executed. \\nThe next section describes your role during project closedown, the final phase of the \\nproject management process.\\nTable 3-2  Project Team Communication Methods\\nProcedure Formality Use\\nProject workbook High Inform\\nPermanent record\\nMeetings Medium to high Resolve issues\\nSeminars and workshops Low to medium Inform\\nProject newsletters Medium to high Inform\\nStatus reports High Inform\\nSpecification documents High Inform\\nPermanent record\\nMinutes of meetings High Inform\\nPermanent record\\nBulletin boards Low Inform\\nMemos Medium to high Inform\\nBrown bag lunches Low Inform\\nHallway discussions Low Inform\\nResolve issues'),\n",

Projects can con-\\nclude with a natural or unnatural termination. A natural termination occurs when \\nthe requirements of the project have been met—the project has been completed \\nand is a success. An unnatural termination occurs when the project is stopped be-\\nfore completion (Keil et al., 2000). Several events can cause an unnatural termi-\\nnation of a project. For example, it may be learned that the assumption used to \\nguide the project proved to be false, that the performance of the systems or devel-\\nopment group was somehow inadequate, or that the requirements are no longer \\nrelevant or valid in the customer’s business environment. The most likely reasons \\nfor the unnatural termination of a project relate to running out of time or money, \\nor both. Regardless of the project termination outcome, several activities must be \\nperformed: closing down the project, conducting post-project reviews, and closing the \\ncustomer contract. Within the context of the SDLC, project closedown occurs after the \\nimplementation phase. The system maintenance phase typically represents an ongoing \\nseries of projects, each of which must be individually managed. Figure 3-17 summa-\\nrizes the project closedown activities that are described more fully in the remainder \\nof this section:\\n1. Closing down the project. During closedown, you perform several diverse activi-\\nties. For example, if you have several team members working with you, project \\ncompletion may signify job and assignment changes for some members. You will \\nlikely be required to assess each team member and provide an appraisal for per-\\nsonnel files and salary determination. You may also want to provide career advice \\nto team members, write letters to superiors praising special accomplishments of \\nteam members, and send thank-you letters to those who helped but were not \\nteam members. As project manager, you must be prepared to handle possible \\nnegative personnel issues such as job termination, especially if the project was \\nnot successful. When closing down the project, it is also important to notify all \\ninterested parties that the project has been completed and to finalize all project \\ndocumentation and financial records so that a final review of the project can be \\nconducted. You should also celebrate the accomplishments of the team. Some \\nteams will hold a party, and each team member may receive memorabilia (e.g., a \\nT-shirt with “I survived the X project”). The goal is to celebrate the team’s effort \\nto bring a difficult task to a successful conclusion.\\n2. Conducting postproject reviews. Once you have closed down the project, final re-\\nviews of the project should be conducted with management and customers. The \\nobjective of these reviews is to determine the strengths and weaknesses of project \\ndeliverables, the processes used to create them, and the project management \\nprocess. It is important that everyone understands what went right and what went \\nwrong in order to improve the process for the next project. Remember, the sys-\\ntems development methodology adopted by an organization is a living guideline \\nthat must undergo continual improvement.\\n3. Closing the customer contract. The focus of this final activity is to ensure that all \\ncontractual terms of the project have been met. A project governed by a contrac-\\ntual agreement is typically not completed until agreed to by both parties, often in \\nwriting. Thus, it is imperative that you gain agreement from your customer that \\nall contractual obligations have been met and that further work is either their \\nresponsibility or covered under another SSR or contract.\\nClosedown is a very important activity. A project is not complete until it is closed, \\nand it is at closedown that projects are deemed a success or failure. Completion also \\nsignifies the chance to begin a new project and to apply what you have learned. Now \\nthat you have an understanding of the project management process, the next sec-\\ntion describes specific techniques used in systems development for representing and \\nscheduling activities and resources.\\nProject closedown\\nThe final phase of the project management \\nprocess that focuses on bringing a project \\nto an end.\\nProject Closedown\\n1.

These planning documents can take the form of graphical \\nor textual reports, although graphical reports have become most popular for depict-\\ning project plans. The most commonly used methods are Gantt charts and network \\ndiagrams. Because Gantt charts do not (typically) show how tasks must be ordered \\n(precedence) but simply show when a task should begin and when it should end, \\nthey are often more useful for depicting relatively simple projects or subparts of a \\nlarger project, showing the activities of a single worker, or monitoring the progress \\nof activities compared to scheduled completion dates (Figure 3-18). Recall that a net-\\nwork diagram shows the ordering of activities by connecting a task to its predecessor \\nand successor tasks. Sometimes a network diagram is preferable; other times a Gantt \\nFIGURE 3-18 \\nGraphical diagrams that depict project \\nplans\\n(a) A Gantt chart\\n(b) A network diagram\\n(Source: Microsoft Corporation.)\\n'),\n",

Here are the key differences be -\\ntween these two charts:\\n•\\t Gantt charts visually show the duration of tasks, whereas a network diagram visu-\\nally shows the sequence dependencies between tasks.\\n•\\t Gantt charts visually show the time overlap of tasks, whereas a network diagram \\ndoes not show time overlap but does show which tasks could be done in parallel.\\n•\\t Some forms of Gantt charts can visually show slack time available within an earli-\\nest start and latest finish duration. A network diagram shows this by data within \\nactivity rectangles.\\nProject managers also use textual reports that depict resource utilization by \\ntask, complexity of the project, and cost distributions to control activities. For ex -\\nample, Figure 3-19 shows a screen from Microsoft Project for Windows that summa -\\nrizes all project activities, their durations in weeks, and their scheduled starting and \\nending dates. Most project managers use computer-based systems to help develop \\ntheir graphical and textual reports. Later in this chapter, we discuss these automated \\nsystems in more detail.\\nA project manager will periodically review the status of all ongoing project task \\nactivities to assess whether the activities will be completed early, on time, or late. If \\nearly or late, the duration of the activity, depicted in column 2 of Figure 3-19, can \\nbe updated. Once changed, the scheduled start and finish times of all subsequent \\ntasks will also change. Making such a change will also alter a Gantt chart or network \\ndiagram used to represent the project tasks. The ability to easily make changes to \\na project is a very powerful feature of most project management environments. It \\nenables the project manager to determine easily how changes in task duration affect \\nthe project completion date. It is also useful for examining the impact of “what if” \\nscenarios of adding or reducing resources, such as personnel, for an activity.\\nrepresenting Project Plans\\nProject scheduling and management require that time, costs, and resources be con -\\ntrolled.

Network diagrams are composed of circles or rect-\\nangles representing activities and connecting arrows showing required work flows, as \\nillustrated in Figure 3-20.\\nCalculating expected time durations using Pert\\nOne of the most difficult and most error-prone activities when constructing a project \\nschedule is the determination of the time duration for each task within a work break-\\ndown structure. It is particularly problematic to make these estimates when there is a \\nhigh degree of complexity and uncertainty about a task. PERT (Program Evaluation \\nReview Technique) is a technique that uses optimistic, pessimistic, and realistic time \\nestimates to calculate the expected time for a particular task. This technique can \\nhelp you to obtain a better time estimate when there is some uncertainty as to how \\nmuch time a task will require to be completed.\\nThe optimistic (o) and pessimistic (p) times reflect the minimum and maximum \\npossible periods of time for an activity to be completed. The realistic (r) time, or most \\nlikely time, reflects the project manager’s “best guess” of the amount of time the activ-\\nity actually will require for completion. Once each of these estimates is made for an ac-\\ntivity, an expected time (ET) can be calculated. Because the expected completion time \\nshould be closest to the realistic (r) time, it is typically weighted four times more than \\nthe optimistic (o) and pessimistic (p) times. Once you add these values together, it must \\nbe divided by six to determine the ET. This equation is shown in the following formula:\\nET =\\no + 4r + p\\n6\\nwhere\\nET = expected time for the completion for an activity\\no = optimistic completion time for an activity\\nr = realistic completion time for an activity\\np = pessimistic completion time for an activity\\nFor example, suppose that your instructor asked you to calculate an expected \\ntime for the completion of an upcoming programming assignment.

One of the fastest grow-\\ning of these markets is economically priced furniture suitable for college students. \\nManagement has requested that a new Sales Promotion Tracking System (SPTS) be \\ndeveloped. This project has already successfully moved through project initiation and \\nis currently in the detailed project planning stage, which corresponds to the SDLC \\nphase of project initiation and planning. The SPTS will be used to track purchases \\nby college students for the next fall semester. Students typically purchase low-priced \\nbeds, bookcases, desks, tables, chairs, and dressers. Because PVF does not normally \\nstock a large quantity of lower-priced items, management feels that a tracking system \\nwill help provide information about the college-student market that can be used for \\nfollow-up sales promotions (e.g., a midterm futon sale).\\nThe project is to design, develop, and implement this information system be-\\nfore the start of the fall term in order to collect sales data at the next major buying \\nperiod. This deadline gives the project team 24 weeks to develop and implement the \\nsystem. The Systems Priority Board at PVF wants to make a decision this week based \\non the feasibility of completing the project within the 24-week deadline. Using PVF’s \\nproject planning methodology, the project manager, Jim Woo, knows that the next \\nstep is to construct a Gantt chart and network diagram of the project to represent \\nthe Baseline Project Plan so that he can use these charts to estimate the likelihood of \\ncompleting the project within 24 weeks. A major activity of project planning focuses \\non dividing the project into manageable activities, estimating times for each, and \\nsequencing their order. Here are the steps Jim followed to do this:\\n1. Identify each activity to be completed in the project. After discussing the new SPTS \\nwith PVF’s management, sales, and development staff, Jim identified the follow-\\ning major activities for the project:\\n•\\t Requirements collection\\n•\\t Screen design\\n•\\t Report design\\n•\\t Database construction\\n•\\t User documentation creation\\n•\\t Software programming\\n•\\t System testing\\n•\\t System installation\\n2. Determine time estimates and calculate the expected completion time for each activity. After \\nidentifying the major project activities, Jim established optimistic, realistic, and \\npessimistic time estimates for each activity. These numbers were then used to cal-\\nculate the expected completion times for all project activities, as described pre-\\nviously using PERT. Figure 3-21 shows the estimated time calculations for each \\nactivity of the SPTS project.\\n3. Determine the sequence of the activities and precedence relationships among all activities by \\nconstructing a Gantt chart and network diagram. This step helps you to understand \\nhow various activities are related. Jim starts by determining the order in which \\nactivities should take place. The results of this analysis for the SPTS project are \\nshown in Figure 3-22. The first row of this figure shows that no activities precede '),\n",

Row 2 shows that screen design must be preceded by \\nrequirements collection. Row 4 shows that both screen and report design must \\nprecede database construction. Thus, activities may be preceded by zero, one, or \\nmore activities.\\nUsing the estimated time and activity sequencing information from \\nFigures 3-21 and 3-22, Jim can now construct a Gantt chart and network diagram \\nof the project’s activities. To construct the Gantt chart, a horizontal bar is drawn \\nfor each activity that reflects its sequence and duration, as shown in Figure 3-23. \\nThe Gantt chart may not, however, show direct interrelationships between activi-\\nties. For example, the fact that the database design activity begins right after the \\nscreen design and report design bars finish does not imply that these two activi-\\nties must finish before database design can begin. To show such precedence rela-\\ntionships, a network diagram must be used. The Gantt chart in Figure 3-23 does, \\nhowever, show precedence relationships.\\nNetwork diagrams have two major components: arrows and nodes.  Arrows \\nreflect the sequence of activities, whereas nodes reflect activities that con-\\nsume time and resources. A network diagram for the SPTS project is shown \\nin Figure 3-24. This diagram has eight nodes labeled 1 through 8.\\n4. Determine the critical path. The critical path of a network diagram is represented \\nby the sequence of connected activities that produce the longest overall time \\nperiod. All nodes and activities within this sequence are referred to as being “on” \\nthe critical path. The critical path represents the shortest time in which a project \\ncan be completed. In other words, any activity on the critical path that is delayed \\nin completion delays the entire project. Nodes not on the critical path, however, \\ncan be delayed (for some amount of time) without delaying the final completion \\nof the project. Nodes not on the critical path contain slack time and allow the \\nproject manager some flexibility in scheduling.\\nSlack time\\nThe amount of time that an activity can be \\ndelayed without delaying the project.\\nCritical path\\nThe shortest time in which a project can be \\ncompleted.\\nACTIVITY\\n1.

To determine the \\ncritical path, Jim calculated the earliest and latest expected completion time for each \\nactivity. He found each activity’s earliest expected completion time (TE) by summing \\nthe estimated time (ET) for each activity from left to right (i.e., in precedence order), \\nstarting at activity 1 and working toward activity 8. In this case, TE for activity 8 is equal to \\n22 weeks. If two or more activities precede an activity, the largest expected  completion \\ntime of these activities is used in calculating the new activity’s expected completion \\ntime. For example, because activity 8 is preceded by both activities 5 and 7, the largest \\nexpected completion time between 5 and 7 is 21, so T E for activity 8 is 21 + 1, or 22. \\nThe earliest expected completion time for the last activity of the project represents the \\namount of time the project should take to complete. Because the time of each activ -\\nity can vary, however, the projected completion time represents only an estimate. The \\nproject may in fact require more or less time for completion.\\nThe latest expected completion time (T L) refers to the time in which an activ -\\nity can be completed without delaying the project. To find the values for each activ -\\nity’s TL, Jim started at activity 8 and set T L equal to the final T E (22 weeks). Next, \\nhe worked right to left toward activity 1 and subtracted the expected time for each \\nactivity. The slack time for each activity is equal to the difference between its latest \\nand earliest expected completion times (T L – TE). Figure 3-26 shows the slack time \\ncalculations for all activities of the SPTS project. All activities with a slack time equal \\nto zero are on the critical path. Thus, all activities except activity 5 are on the critical \\npath. Part of the diagram in Figure 3-25 shows two critical paths, between activities \\n1-2-4 and 1-3-4, because both of these parallel activities have zero slack.\\nIn addition to the possibility of having multiple critical paths, there are actu -\\nally two possible types of slack.

Total slack \\nrefers to the amount of time a task can be delayed without delaying the completion \\nof the project.

New versions of these tools are continuously being de-\\nveloped and released by software vendors. Most of the available tools have a set of \\ncommon features that include the ability to define and order tasks, assign resources \\nto tasks, and easily modify tasks and resources. Project management tools are available \\nto run on IBM-compatible personal computers, the Macintosh, and larger mainframe \\nand workstation-based systems. These systems vary in the number of task activities sup-\\nported, the complexity of relationships, system processing and storage requirements, \\nand, of course, cost. Prices for these systems can range from a few hundred dollars \\nfor personal computer–based systems to more than $100,000 for large-scale, multi-\\nproject systems. Yet a lot can be done with systems such as Microsoft Project as well \\nas public domain and shareware systems. For example, numerous shareware project \\nmanagement programs (e.g., OpenProj, Bugzilla, and eGroupWare) can be down-\\nloaded from the web (e.g., at www.download.com).

When using \\nthis system to manage a project, you need to perform at least the following activities:\\n•\\t Establish a project starting or ending date.\\n•\\t Enter tasks and assign task relationships.\\n•\\t Select a scheduling method to review project reports.\\nestablishing a Project Start date\\nDefining the general project information includes obtaining the name of the project \\nand the project manager, and the starting or ending date of the project. Starting \\nand ending dates are used to schedule future activities or backdate others (see the \\nfollowing) based on their duration and relationships with other activities. An ex -\\nample from Microsoft Project for Windows of the data entry screen for establishing \\na project starting or ending date is shown in Figure 3-27. This screen shows PVF’s \\nPurchasing Fulfillment System project. Here, the starting date for the project is \\nMonday, November 6, 2017.\\nentering tasks and assigning task relationships\\nThe next step in defining a project is to define project tasks and their relation -\\nships. For the Purchasing Fulfillment System project, Chris defined 11 tasks to be \\ncompleted when he performed the initial system analysis activities for the project \\n(task 1—Start Analysis Phase—is a summary task that is used to group related tasks). \\nThe task entry screen, shown in Figure 3-28, is similar to a financial spreadsheet \\nprogram. The user moves the cursor to a cell with arrow keys or the mouse and then \\nsimply enters a textual Name and a numeric Duration for each activity. Scheduled \\nStart and Scheduled Finish are automatically entered based on the project start date \\nand duration. To set an activity relationship, the ID number (or numbers) of the \\nactivity that must be completed before the start of the current activity is entered into \\nthe Predecessors column. Additional codes under this column make the precedence \\nrelationships more precise. For example, consider the Predecessor column for ID 6. \\nThe entry in this cell says that activity 6 cannot start until one day before the finish of \\nactivity 5. (Microsoft Project provides many different options for precedence and de-\\nlays, as demonstrated in this example, but discussion of these is beyond the scope of \\nour coverage.) The project management software uses this information to construct \\nGantt charts, network diagrams, and other project-related reports.\\nFIGURE 3-27 \\nEstablishing a project starting date in \\nMicrosoft Project for Windows\\n(Source: Microsoft Corporation.)'),\n",

Other features that \\nare widely available and especially useful for multiperson projects relate to resource \\nusage and utilization. Resource-related features enable you to define characteristics \\nsuch as standard costing rates and daily availability via a calendar that records holi -\\ndays, working hours, and vacations. These features are particularly useful for billing \\nand estimating project costs. Often, resources are shared across multiple projects, \\nwhich could significantly affect a project’s schedule.\\nDepending on how projects are billed within an organization, assigning and bill-\\ning resources to tasks can be a very time-consuming activity for most project managers. \\nThe features provided in these powerful tools can greatly ease the planning and man-\\naging of projects so that project and management resources are effectively utilized.\\nFIGURE 3-30 \\nGantt chart showing progress of activities \\n(right frame) versus planned activities (left \\nframe)\\n(Source: Microsoft Corporation.)\\nSummary\\nThe focus of this chapter was on managing information \\nsystems projects and the role of the project manager in \\nthis process. A project manager has both technical and \\nmanagerial skills and is ultimately responsible for deter -\\nmining the size, scope, and resource requirements for \\na project. Once a project is deemed feasible by an orga -\\nnization, the project manager ensures that the project \\nmeets the customer’s needs and is delivered within budget \\nand time constraints. To manage the project, the project \\nmanager must execute four primary activities: project ini -\\ntiation, project planning, project execution, and project \\nclosedown. The focus of project initiation is on assessing \\nthe size, scope, and complexity of a project and on estab -\\nlishing procedures to support later project activities. The \\nfocus of project planning is on defining clear, discrete \\nactivities and the work needed to complete each activity. \\nThe focus of project execution is on putting the plans \\ndeveloped in project initiation and planning into action. \\nProject closedown focuses on bringing the project to an \\nend.\\nGantt charts and network diagrams are powerful \\ngraphical techniques used in planning and controlling \\nprojects. Both Gantt charts and network diagram schedul-\\ning techniques require that a project have activities that \\ncan be defined as having a clear beginning and end, can \\nbe worked on independently of other activities, are or -\\ndered, and are such that their completion signifies the \\nend of the project. Gantt charts use horizontal bars to \\nrepresent the beginning, duration, and ending of an ac -\\ntivity. Network diagramming is a critical path scheduling \\nmethod that shows the interrelationships among activi -\\nties. Critical path scheduling refers to planning methods \\nwhereby the order and duration of the project’s activities \\ndirectly affect the completion date of the project. These '),\n",

These \\nconcepts and techniques are very robust to a broad range of \\nprojects and development approaches. However, when de-\\nveloping a system using a more iterative design approach—\\nsuch as prototyping or object-oriented analysis and design—\\nthere are some additional issues to  consider. In this section, \\nwe will discuss some unique characteristics of these types of \\nprojects (see Fuller et al., 2008; George et al., 2007).\\nWhen a system is developed using an iterative \\n approach, it means that, over the duration of the project, \\na portion of the final system is constructed during each it-\\neration phase. In this way, the system evolves incrementally \\nso that by the last iteration of the project, the entire system \\nis completed (see Figure 3-31). In order for the system to \\nevolve in this manner, the project manager must under-\\nstand several unique characteristics of an OOSAD project.\\ndeFIne the SySteM aS a Set   \\noF CoMPonentS\\nIn order to manage the project as a series of iterations, the \\nproject manager must subdivide the overall system into a \\nset of components; when combined, this set will yield the \\nentire system (see Figure 3-32). Each of these separate sys-\\ntem components is often referred to as a “vertical slice” of \\nthe overall system; this is a key feature of the system that can \\nbe demonstrated to users. Alternatively, each slice should \\nnot be a subsystem that spans “horizontally” throughout \\nthe entire system because these horizontal slices typically \\nLearning Objectives\\nAfter studying this section, you should be able to\\n3a.1 describe the unique characteristics of an OOSAD \\nproject.\\ndo not focus on a specific system feature, nor are they typi-\\ncally good for demonstration to users. Basically, each verti-\\ncal slice represents a use case of the system (see Chapter 7 \\nfor more information on use case diagrams). Also, note in \\nFigure 3-32 that project management and planning is an \\nactivity that continues throughout the life of the project.\\nOne outcome of defining the overall system as a collec-\\ntion of components is the likelihood that the components \\nconstructed earlier in the project will require greater rework \\nthan those developed later in the project. For example, dur-\\ning the early stages of the project, missing components or \\na lack of understanding of key architectural features will \\nrequire that components developed early in the project be \\nmodified substantially as the project moves forward in order \\nto integrate these components into a single comprehensive \\nsystem successfully. This means that rework is a natural part \\nof an OOSAD project and that one should not be overly con-\\ncerned when this occurs. It is simply a characteristic of the \\niterative and incremental development process of OOSAD.\\nComplete hard Problems First\\nAnother characteristic of the OOSAD approach is that it \\ntackles the hard problems first. In classic structured systems \\ndevelopment, a hard problem, such as choosing the physi-\\ncal implementation environment, is addressed late in the \\ndevelopment process. As a result, following a classic systems \\ndevelopment approach tends to result in putting off making \\nsome of the key systems architectural decisions until late in \\nthe project. This approach is sometimes problematic because \\nsuch decisions often determine whether a project is a success \\nappendix \\nobject-oriented \\nanalysis and design\\nProject Management\\nunique characteristics of an ooSad Project'),\n",

On the other hand, addressing hard problems as early as possible allows \\nthe difficult problems to be examined before substantial resources have been expended. \\nThis mitigates project risk.\\nIn addition, completing the harder problems associated with the systems archi-\\ntecture as early as possible helps in completing all subsequent components because \\nmost will build upon these basic architectural capabilities. (With some projects, the \\nhardest components depend upon simpler components. In these cases, one must \\ncomplete the simpler slices first before moving to the harder ones. Nonetheless, focus \\nshould be placed on the hard problems as soon as possible.) From a project planning \\nperspective, this means that there is a natural progression and ordering of compo-\\nnents over the life of the project. The initial iteration or two must focus on the system \\narchitecture such as the database or networking infrastructure. Once the architec-\\nture is completed, core system capabilities, such as creating and deleting records, are \\nimplemented. After the core system components are completed, detailed system fea-\\ntures are implemented that help to fine-tune key system capabilities. During the final \\niteration phases, the primary focus is on activities that bring the project to a close \\n(e.g., interface refinement, user manuals, and training; see Figure 3-33).\\nEvolving Prototypes\\nStart of Project End of Project\\nCompleted System\\nIteration 1I teration 2I teration FIGURE 3-31 \\nDuring the OOSAD process, the system \\nevolves incrementally over the life of the \\nproject\\nIterations\\nSlices\\nStart of Project End of Project\\n123456\\nComponent 1\\nComponent 2 Component 3 Component 4 Component 5 Component 6 Component 7 Component 8 Component 9\\nComponent 10 Component 11 Component 12\\nComponent    -1\\nComponent\\nOngoing Project Management and Planning\\nFIGURE 3-32 \\nObject-oriented development \\nprojects are developed using \\nongoing management and \\nevolving system functionality'),\n",

This means that each project iteration has management \\nand planning, analysis, design, and implementation and operation activities. For \\neach iteration, the inputs to the process are the allocated project components—verti-\\ncal slices or use cases—to perform during this iteration and the results from the prior \\niteration. The results of this iteration are then used as inputs to the next iteration. \\nFor example, as components are designed and implemented, much is learned about \\nhow subsequent components will need to be implemented. The learning that occurs \\nduring each iteration helps the project manager gain a better understanding about \\nhow subsequent components will be designed, what problems might occur, what re-\\nsources are needed, and how long and complex a component will be to complete. \\nAs a result, most experienced project managers believe that it is a mistake to make \\nproject plans too detailed early in the project when much is still unknown.\\ndon’t Plan too Much up Front\\nDuring each iteration, more and more will be learned about how subsequent com-\\nponents will need to be designed, how long each might take to complete, and so on. \\nTherefore, it is a mistake to make highly detailed plans far into the future because it \\nis likely that these plans will be wrong. In OOSAD, as each iteration is completed, the \\ngoal is to learn more about the system being constructed, the capabilities of the de-\\nvelopment team, the complexity of the development environment, and so on. As this \\nunderstanding is gained over the course of the project, the project manager is able \\nto make better and better predictions and plans. As a result, making highly detailed \\nplans for all project iterations is likely to result in a big waste of time. The project \\nmanager should be concerned only with making highly detailed plans for the next \\niteration or two. As the project manager learns over the course of the project, he or \\nshe will be able to continually refine schedules, time estimates, and resource require-\\nments with better and better estimates (see Figure 3-35).\\nStart of Project\\nFocus\\nEnd of Project\\n1 23456\\nComponent 1\\nComponent 2 Component 3 Component 4 Component 5 Component 6 Component 7 Component 8 Component 9\\nComponent 10 Component 11 Component 12\\nArchitecture Core Features Detailed Features Completion\\nIterations\\nOngoing Project Management and Planning\\nComponent    -1\\nComponent\\nFIGURE 3-33 \\nThe focus and ordering of \\nsystem components change \\nover the life of the project'),\n",

Iterations are designed to be a fixed \\nlength of time, typically from two to eight weeks, but they can be as short as one week \\n(especially for smaller projects). During a single iteration, multiple components (use \\ncases) can be completed. However, it is important not to try to pack the develop-\\nment of too many components into a single iteration.

Likewise, elabora-\\ntion often is completed in one or two iterations, but again system complexity and size \\ncan influence this. Construction can range from two to several iterations, and transi-\\ntion typically occurs over one or two iterations. Thus, experienced OOSAD project \\nmanagers typically use from six to nine iterations when designing and constructing a \\nsystem (see Figure 3-36). Note that all completed components are integrated into a \\ncomprehensive system at the conclusion of each iteration. During the first iteration, it \\nis likely that simple component prototypes, such as file opening, closing, and saving, \\nwill be created.

This means that organizations must \\nset priorities and a direction for systems development \\nthat will yield development projects with the greatest net \\nbenefits. As a systems analyst, you must analyze user in-\\nformation requirements, and you must also help make \\nthe business case—or justify why the system should be \\nbuilt and the development project conducted.\\nThe reason for any new or improved information \\nsystem (IS) is to add value to the organization. As systems \\nanalysts, we must choose to use systems development re-\\nsources to build the mix of systems that add the greatest \\nvalue to the organization. How can we determine the busi-\\nness value of systems and identify those applications that \\nprovide the most critical gains? Part Two addresses this \\ntopic, the first phase of the systems development life cycle \\n(SDLC), which we call planning. Business value comes \\nfrom supporting the most critical business goals and help-\\ning the organization deliver on its business strategy. All \\nsystems, whether supporting operational or strategic func-\\ntions, must be linked to business goals. The two chapters \\nin this part of the book show how to make this linkage.\\nThe source of systems projects is either initiatives \\nfrom IS planning (proactive identification of systems) \\nor requests from users or IS professionals (reactions to \\nproblems or opportunities) for new or enhanced systems. \\nIn Chapter 4, we outline the linkages among corporate \\nplanning, IS planning, and the identification and selec-\\ntion of projects. We do not include IS planning as part \\nof the SDLC, but the results of IS planning greatly influ-\\nence the birth and conduct of systems projects. Chapter \\n4 makes a strong argument that IS planning provides not \\nonly insights into choosing which systems an organiza-\\ntion needs, but also describes the strategies necessary for \\nevaluating the viability of any potential systems project.\\nA more frequent source of project identification \\noriginates from system service requests (SSRs) from \\nbusiness managers and IS professionals, usually for \\nvery focused systems or incremental improvements in \\nexisting systems. Business managers request a new or \\nreplacement system when they believe that improved in-\\nformation services will help them do their jobs. IS profes-\\nsionals may request system updates when technological \\nchanges make current system implementations obsolete \\nor when the performance of an existing system needs im-\\nprovement. In either case, the request for service must \\nbe understood by management, and a justification for \\nthe system and associated project must be developed.\\nWe continue with the Petrie Electronics case fol-\\nlowing Chapter 4. In this case, we show how an idea for a \\nnew IS project was stimulated by a synergy between cor-\\nporate strategic planning and the creativity of an indi-\\nvidual business manager.\\nChapter 5 focuses on what happens after a project \\nhas been identified and selected: the next step in mak-\\ning the business case, initiating and planning the pro-\\nposed system request. This plan develops a better under-\\nstanding of the scope of the potential system change and \\nthe nature of the needed system features. From this pre-\\nliminary understanding of system requirements, a proj-\\nect plan is developed that shows both the detailed steps \\nand resources needed in order to conduct the analysis \\nphase of the life cycle and the more general steps for \\nsubsequent phases. The feasibility and potential risks of \\nthe requested system are also outlined, and an economic \\ncost–benefit analysis is conducted to show the potential \\nimpact of the system change. In addition to the economic \\nfeasibility or justification of the system, technical, organi-\\nzational, political, legal, schedule, and other feasibilities \\nare assessed. Potential risks—unwanted outcomes—are \\nidentified, and plans for dealing with these possibilities \\nare identified. Project initiation and planning end when \\na formal proposal for the systems development project \\nis completed and submitted for approval to the person \\nwho must commit the resources to systems development. \\nIf approved, the project moves into the analysis phase of \\nthe SDLC.\\nWe illustrate a typical project initiation and plan-\\nning phase in a Petrie Electronics case following Chapter \\n5. In this case, we show how the company developed its \\nproject scope statement and addressed various aspects of \\nthe project’s initiation and planning stage.\\nPart two \\nPlanning'),\n",

Managers, knowledge workers, and all \\nother organizational members expect to easily access \\nand retrieve information, regardless of its location. \\nNonintegrated systems used in the past—often referred \\nto as “islands of information”—are being replaced with \\ncooperative, integrated enterprise systems that can eas-\\nily support information sharing. Although the goal of \\nbuilding bridges between these “islands” will take some \\ntime to achieve, it represents a clear direction for infor-\\nmation systems development. The use of enterprise re-\\nsource planning (ERP) systems from companies such as \\nSAP (www.sap.com) and Oracle (www.oracle.com), has \\nenabled the linking of these “islands” in many organiza-\\ntions. Additionally, as the use of the Internet continues \\nto evolve to support business activities, systems integra-\\ntion has become a paramount concern of organizations \\n(Fox, 2013; Luftman, 2004; Overby, 2006; Wailgum, 2010; \\nWesterman et al., 2014; Weill and Ross, 2009).\\nObtaining integrated, enterprise-wide computing \\npresents significant challenges for both corporate and \\ninformation systems management. For example, given \\nthe proliferation of personal and departmental comput-\\ning wherein disparate systems and databases have been \\ncreated, how can the organization possibly control and \\nmaintain all of these systems and data? In many cases they \\nsimply cannot; it is nearly impossible to track who has \\nwhich systems and what data, where there are overlaps \\nor inconsistencies, and the accuracy of the information. \\nThe reason that personal and departmental systems and \\ndatabases abound is that users are either unaware of the \\ninformation that exists in corporate databases or they can-\\nnot easily get at it, so they create and maintain their own \\ninformation and systems. Intelligent identification and \\nselection of system projects, for both new and replace-\\nment systems, is a critical step in gaining control of sys-\\ntems and data. It is the hope of many chief information \\nofficers (CIOs) that with the advent of ERP systems, im-\\nproved system integration, and the rapid deployment of \\ncorporate Internet solutions, these islands will be reduced \\nor eliminated (Fox, 2013; Harvard Business Review, 2011; \\nLuftman, 2004; Newbold and Azua, 2007; Olavsrud, 2014; \\nWeill and Ross, 2009; Wailgum, 2010).\\nThe acquisition, development, and maintenance \\nof information systems consume substantial resources \\nfor most organizations.

During project iden-\\ntification and selection, a senior manager, a business group, an IS manager, or a \\nsteering committee identifies and assesses all possible systems development projects \\nthat an organization unit could undertake. Next, those projects deemed most likely \\nto yield significant organizational benefits, given available resources, are selected for \\nsubsequent development activities. Organizations vary in their approach to identify-\\ning and selecting projects. In some organizations, project identification and selection \\nis a very formal process in which projects are outcomes of a larger overall planning \\nprocess. For example, a large organization may follow a formal project identifica-\\ntion process whereby a proposed project is rigorously compared with all competing \\nprojects. Alternatively, a small organization may use informal project selection pro-\\ncesses that allow the highest-ranking IS manager to independently select projects or \\nallow individual business units to decide on projects after agreeing to provide project \\nfunding.\\nInformation systems development requests come from a variety of sources. \\nOne source is requests by managers and business units for replacing or extending \\nan existing system to gain needed information or to provide a new service to cus-\\ntomers. Another source for requests is IS managers who want to make a system more \\nefficient and less costly to operate, or want to move it to a new operating environ-\\nment. A final source of projects is a formal planning group that identifies projects \\nfor improvement to help the organization meet its corporate objectives (e.g., a new \\nsystem to provide better customer service). Regardless of how a given organization \\nactually executes the project identification and selection process, a common se-\\nquence of activities occurs.

Identifying potential development projects\\n2. Classifying and ranking IS development projects\\n3. Selecting IS development projects\\nEach of these steps is described below:\\n1. Identifying potential development projects. Organizations vary as to how they identify \\nprojects. This process can be performed by\\n•\\t a key member of top management, either the CEO of a small- or medium-\\nsized organization or a senior executive in a larger organization;\\n•\\t a steering committee, composed of a cross section of managers with an inter -\\nest in systems;\\n•\\t user departments, in which either the head of the requesting unit or a com-\\nmittee from the requesting department decides which projects to submit \\n (often you, as a systems analyst, will help users prepare such requests); or\\n•\\t the development group or a senior IS manager.\\nAll methods of identification have been found to have strengths and weak-\\nnesses. Research has found, for example, that projects identified by top man-\\nagement more often have a strategic organizational focus. Alternatively, projects \\nidentified by steering committees more often reflect the diversity of the commit-\\ntee and therefore have a cross-functional focus. Projects identified by individual \\ndepartments or business units most often have a narrow, tactical focus. Finally, a \\ndominant characteristic of projects identified by the development group is the \\nease with which existing hardware and systems will integrate with the proposed \\nproject. Other factors, such as project cost, duration, complexity, and risk, are \\nalso influenced by the source of a given project. Characteristics of each selection \\nmethod are briefly summarized in Table 4-1. In addition to who makes the deci-\\nsion, characteristics specific to the organization—such as the level of firm diversi-\\nfication, level of vertical integration, or extent of growth opportunities—can also \\ninfluence any investment or project selection decision (Dewan et al., 1998; Fox, \\n2013; Harvard Business Review, 2009; Luftman, 2004; Yoo et al., 2006; Thomas \\nand Fernandez, 2008; Weill and Ross, 2009).\\nTable 4-1   Characteristics of alternative Methods for Making Information Systems  \\nIdentification and Selection Decisions\\nSelection Method Characteristics\\nTop Management Greater strategic focus\\nLargest project size\\nLongest project duration\\nEnterprise-wide consideration\\nSteering Committee Cross-functional focus\\nGreater organizational change\\nFormal cost–benefit analysis\\nLarger and riskier projects\\nFunctional Area Narrow, nonstrategic focus\\nFaster development\\nFewer users, management layers, and business \\nfunctions involved\\nDevelopment Group Integration with existing systems focus\\nFewer development delays\\nLess concern with cost–benefit analysis\\n(Source: Based on McKeen, Guimaraes, and Wetherbe, 1994; GAO, 2000.)'),\n",

This occurs because top management and steering committees are likely \\nto have a broader understanding of overall business objectives and constraints. \\nProjects identified by top management or by a diverse steering committee are \\ntherefore referred to as coming from a top-down source.\\nProjects identified by a functional manager, business unit, or by the infor -\\nmation systems development group are often designed for a particular business \\nneed within a given business unit. In other words, these projects may not reflect \\nthe overall objectives of the organization. This does not mean that projects iden-\\ntified by individual managers, business units, or the IS development group are \\ndeficient, only that they may not consider broader organizational issues. Project \\ninitiatives stemming from managers, business units, or the development group \\nare generally referred to as coming from a bottom-up source. These are the types \\nof projects in which you, as a systems analyst, will have the earliest role in the life \\ncycle as part of your ongoing support of users. You will help user managers pro-\\nvide the description of information needs and the reasons for doing the project \\nthat will be evaluated in selecting, among all submitted projects, which ones will \\nbe approved to move into the project initiation and planning phase of the SDLC.\\nIn sum, projects are identified by both top-down and bottom-up initiatives. \\nThe formality of the process of identifying and selecting projects can vary substan-\\ntially across organizations. Also, because limited resources preclude the develop-\\nment of all proposed systems, most organizations have a process of classifying and \\nranking the merit of each project. Those projects deemed inconsistent with overall \\norganizational objectives, redundant in functionality to some existing system, or \\nunnecessary will thus be removed from consideration. This topic is discussed next.\\n2. Classifying and ranking IS development projects. The second major activity in the \\nproject identification and selection process focuses on assessing the relative \\nmerit of potential projects. As with the project identification process, classifying \\nand ranking projects can be performed by top managers, a steering committee, \\nbusiness units, or the IS development group. Additionally, the criteria used when \\nassigning the relative merit of a given project can vary. Commonly used criteria \\nfor assessing projects are summarized in Table 4-2. In any given organization, \\none or several criteria might be used during the classifying and ranking process.\\nAs with the project identification and selection process, the actual criteria \\nused to assess projects will vary by organization. If, for example, an organization \\nuses a steering committee, it may choose to meet monthly or quarterly to review \\nTable 4-2  Possible evaluation Criteria When Classifying and Ranking Projects\\nEvaluation Criteria Description\\nValue Chain Analysis Extent to which activities add value and costs \\nwhen developing products and/or services\\nStrategic Alignment Extent to which the project is viewed as \\nhelping the organization achieve its strategic \\nobjectives and long-term goals\\nPotential Benefits Extent to which the project is viewed as \\nimproving profits, customer service, and so \\nforth, and the duration of these benefits\\nResource Availability Amount and type of resources the project \\nrequires and their availability\\nProject Size/Duration Number of individuals and the length of time \\nneeded to complete the project\\nTechnical Difficulty/Risks Level of technical difficulty to successfully \\ncomplete the project within given time and \\nresource constraints'),\n",

At these meetings, new proj-\\nect requests will be reviewed relative to projects already identified, and ongoing \\nprojects are monitored. The relative ratings of projects are used to guide the \\nfinal activity of this identification process—project selection.\\nAn important project evaluation method that is widely used for assessing \\ninformation systems development projects is called value chain analysis (Foss and \\nSaebi, 2015; Porter, 1985; Van den Berg and Pietersma, 2015). Value chain analy-\\nsis is the process of analyzing an organization’s activities for making products \\nand/or services to determine where value is added and costs are incurred. Once \\nan organization gains a clear understanding of its value chain, improvements in \\nthe organization’s operations and performance can be achieved. Information sys-\\ntems projects providing the greatest benefit to the value chain will be given prior-\\nity over those with fewer benefits.\\nAs you might have guessed, information systems have become one of the \\nprimary ways for organizations to make changes and improvements in their value \\nchains. Many organizations, for example, are using the Internet to exchange \\n important business information with suppliers and customers, such as orders, \\n invoices, and receipts. To conduct a value chain analysis for an organization, \\nthink about an organization as a big input/output process (see Figure 4-2). At \\none end are the inputs to the organization, for example, supplies that are pur -\\nchased. Within the organizations, those supplies and resources are integrated in \\nsome way to produce products and services. At the other end are the outputs, \\nwhich represent the products and services that are marketed, sold, and then dis-\\ntributed to customers. In value chain analysis, you must first understand each ac-\\ntivity, function, and process where value is or should be added. Next, determine \\nthe costs (and the factors that drive costs or cause them to fluctuate) within each \\nof the areas. After understanding your value chain and costs, you can benchmark \\n(compare) your value chain and associated costs with those of other organiza-\\ntions, preferably your competitors. By making these comparisons, you can iden-\\ntify priorities for applying information systems projects.\\n3. Selecting IS development projects. The final activity in the project identification and \\nselection process is the actual selection of projects for further development. Proj-\\nect selection is a process of considering both short- and long-term projects and \\nselecting those most likely to achieve business objectives. Additionally, as busi-\\nness conditions change over time, the relative importance of any single project \\nmay substantially change. Thus, the identification and selection of projects is a \\nvery important and ongoing activity.\\nNumerous factors must be considered when making project selection de-\\ncisions. Figure 4-3 shows that a selection decision requires that the perceived \\nneeds of the organization, existing systems and ongoing projects, resource avail-\\nability, evaluation criteria, current business conditions, and the perspectives of \\nthe decision makers will all play a role in project selection decisions. Numerous \\noutcomes can occur from this decision process. Of course, projects can be ac-\\ncepted or rejected. Acceptance of a project usually means that funding to con-\\nduct the next phase of the SDLC has been approved. Rejection means that the \\nproject will no longer be considered for development. However, projects may \\nalso be conditionally accepted; they may be accepted pending the approval or \\nValue chain analysis\\nAnalyzing an organization’s activities \\nto determine where value is added to \\nproducts and/or services and the costs \\nincurred for doing so; usually also includes \\na comparison with the activities, added \\nvalue, and costs of other organizations \\nfor the purpose of making improvements \\nin the organization’s operations and \\nperformance.\\nFigure 4-2 \\nOrganizations can be thought of as a \\nvalue chain, transforming raw materials \\ninto products for customers\\nTransform Raw\\nMaterials into\\nProducts\\nStorage and\\nDistribution\\nof Products\\nMarketing,\\nSales, and\\nCustomer Support\\nSources: Left to right: Bram van \\n Broekhoven/Shutterstock; Alexey \\n Fursov/Shutterstock; TTstudio/Fotolia; \\nKadmy/Fotolia'),\n",

Projects may also be returned to the origi-\\nnal requesters, who are told to develop or purchase the requested system. Finally, \\nthe requesters of a project may be asked to modify and resubmit their request \\nafter making suggested changes or clarifications.\\nOne method for deciding among different projects, or when considering alter-\\nnative designs for a given system, is illustrated in Figure 4-4. For example, suppose \\nthat, for a given system that has been identified and selected, there are three alterna-\\ntive designs that could be pursued—A, B, or C. Let’s also suppose that early planning \\nmeetings identified three key system requirements and four key constraints that could \\nbe used to help make a decision on which alternative to pursue. In the left column \\nof Figure 4-4, three system requirements and four  constraints are listed. Because not \\nall requirements and constraints are of equal importance, they are weighted based \\non their relative importance. In other words, you do not have to weight requirements \\nand constraints equally; it is certainly possible to make requirements more or less \\nimportant than constraints. Weights are arrived at in discussions among the analysis \\nteam, users, and sometimes managers. Weights tend to be fairly subjective and, for \\nCriteria Weight Alternative A Alternative B Alternative C\\nRating Score Rating Score Rating Score\\nRequirements\\nReal-time data entry 18 59 05 90 59 0\\nAutomatic reorder 18 11 85 90 59 0\\nReal-time data query 41 14 57 05 70\\n50 122 250 250\\nConstraints\\nDeveloper costs 15 46 05 75 34 5\\nHardware costs 15 46 04 60 34 5\\nOperating costs1 55 75 11 55 75\\nEase of training 55 25 31 53 15\\n50 220 165 180\\nTotal 100 342 415 430\\n1\\nFigure 4-4 \\nAlternative projects and system design \\ndecisions can be assisted using weighted \\nmulticriteria analysis\\nExisting and\\nAvailable\\nResources\\nPerceived and\\nReal Needs\\nList of Potential\\nand Ongoing\\nProjects\\nCurrent\\nOrganizational\\nEnvironment\\nEvaluation\\nCriteria\\nProject\\nSelection\\nDecision\\nDecision Outcome\\n•  Accept Project\\n•  Reject Project\\n•  Delay Project\\n•  Refocus Project\\n•  End-User Development\\n•  Proof of Concept\\nFigure 4-3 \\nProject selection decisions must consider \\nnumerous factors and can have numerous \\noutcomes'),\n",

Notice that the total of the weights for both the requirements and constraints is \\n100 percent.\\nNext, each requirement and constraint is rated on a scale of 1 to 5. A rating of \\n1 indicates that the alternative does not meet the requirement very well or that the \\nalternative violates the constraint. A rating of 5 indicates that the alternative meets or \\nexceeds the requirement or clearly abides by the constraint. Ratings are even more \\nsubjective than weights and should also be determined through open discussion \\namong users, analysts, and managers. For each requirement and constraint, a score is \\ncalculated by multiplying the rating for each requirement and each constraint by its \\nweight. The final step is to add the weighted scores for each alternative. Notice that \\nwe have included three sets of totals: for requirements, for constraints, and overall to-\\ntals. If you look at the totals for requirements, alternative B or C is the best choice be-\\ncause both meet or exceed all requirements. However, if you look only at constraints, \\nalternative A is the best choice because it does not violate any constraints. When we \\ncombine the totals for requirements and constraints, we see that the best choice is \\nalternative C. Whether alternative C is actually chosen for development, however, is \\nanother issue. The decision makers may choose alternative A, knowing that it does \\nnot meet two key requirements, because it has the lowest cost. In short, what may ap-\\npear to be the best choice for a systems development project may not always be the \\none that ends up being developed. By conducting a thorough analysis, organizations \\ncan greatly improve their decision-making performance.\\nDeliverables and outcomes\\nThe primary deliverable from the first part of the planning phase is a schedule of spe-\\ncific IS development projects, coming from both top-down and bottom-up sources, \\nto move into the next part of the planning phase—project initiation and planning \\n(see Figure 4-5). An outcome of this phase is the assurance that careful consideration \\nwas given to project selection, with a clear understanding of how each project can \\nhelp the organization reach its objectives. Due to the principle of incremental com-\\nmitment, a selected project does not necessarily result in a working system. After each \\nsubsequent SDLC phase, you, other members of the project team, and organizational \\nofficials will reassess your project to determine whether the business conditions have \\nchanged or whether a more detailed understanding of a system’s costs, benefits, and \\nrisks would suggest that the project is not as worthy as previously thought.\\nTop Down\\nBottom Up\\nSchedule of Projects\\n1.   ...\\n2.   ...\\n3.   ...\\nEvaluate,\\nPrioritize, and\\nSchedule\\nProjects\\nSources of\\nPotential Projects\\nProject Identiﬁcation\\nand Selection\\nProject Initiation\\nand Planning\\n• Top Management\\n• Steering Committee\\n• User Departments\\n• Development Group\\nFigure 4-5 \\nInformation systems development projects \\ncome from both top-down and bottom-up \\ninitiatives\\nincremental commitment\\nA strategy in systems analysis and design \\nin which the project is reviewed after each \\nphase and continuation of the project is \\nrejustified.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\ASUS\\\\Desktop\\\\AI powered chatbot\\\\Data\\\\SAD.pdf', 'page': 118}, page_content='94 Part II   Planning\\nMany organizations have found that in order to make good project selection \\ndecisions, a clear understanding of overall organizational business strategy and ob-\\njectives is required. This means that a clear understanding of the business and the \\ndesired role of information systems in achieving organizational goals is a precondi-\\ntion to improving the identification and selection process. In the next section, we \\nprovide a brief overview of the process many organizations follow—involving corpo-\\nrate strategic planning and information systems planning—when setting their busi-\\nness strategy and objectives and when defining the role of information systems in \\ntheir plans.\\nCorPorate anD InformatIon  \\nSyStemS PlannIng\\nAlthough there are numerous motivations for carefully planning the identification \\nand selection of projects (see Atkinson, 1990; Dyche, 2015; Harvard Business Review, \\n2009; Kelly, 2006; Luftman, 2004; Weill and Ross, 2009), organizations have not tra-\\nditionally used a systematic planning process when determining how to allocate IS \\nresources. Instead, projects have often resulted from attempts to solve isolated orga-\\nnizational problems. In effect, organizations have asked the question: “What proce-\\ndure (application program) is required to solve this particular problem as it exists \\ntoday?” The difficulty with this approach is that the required organizational proce-\\ndures are likely to change over time as the environment changes. For example, a \\ncompany may decide to change its method of billing customers or a university may \\nchange its procedure for registering students. When such changes occur, it is usually \\nnecessary to again modify existing information systems.\\nIn contrast, planning-based approaches essentially ask the question: “What in-\\nformation (or data) requirements will satisfy the decision-making needs or business \\nprocesses of the enterprise today and well into the future?” A major advantage of this \\napproach is that an organization’s informational needs are less likely to change (or \\nwill change more slowly) than its business processes. For example, unless an organi-\\nzation fundamentally changes its business, its underlying data structures may remain \\nreasonably stable for more than 10 years. However, the procedures used to access \\nand process the data may change many times during that period. Thus, the challenge \\nof most organizations is to design comprehensive information models containing \\ndata that are relatively independent from the languages and programs used to ac-\\ncess, create, and update them.\\nTo benefit from a planning-based approach for identifying and selecting proj-\\nects, an organization must analyze its information needs and plan its projects care-\\nfully. Without careful planning, organizations may construct databases and systems \\nthat support individual processes but do not provide a resource that can be easily \\nshared throughout the organization. Further, as business processes change, lack of \\ndata and systems integration will hamper the speed at which the organization can ef-\\nfectively make business strategy or process changes.\\nThe need for improved information systems project identification and selec-\\ntion is readily apparent when we consider factors such as the following:\\n1. The cost of information systems has risen steadily and approaches 40 percent of \\ntotal expenses in some organizations.\\n2. Many systems cannot handle applications that cross organizational boundaries.\\n3. Many systems often do not address the critical problems of the business as a \\nwhole or support strategic applications.\\n4. Data redundancy is often out of control, and users may have little confidence in \\nthe quality of data.\\n5. Systems maintenance costs are out of control as old, poorly planned systems must \\nconstantly be revised.'),\n",

Application backlogs often extend three years or more, and frustrated end users \\nare forced to create (or purchase) their own systems, often creating redundant \\ndatabases and incompatible systems in the process.\\nCareful planning and selection of projects alone will certainly not solve all of these \\nproblems. We believe, however, that a disciplined approach, driven by top management \\ncommitment, is a prerequisite for most effectively applying information systems in order \\nto reach organizational objectives. The focus of this section is to provide you with a clear \\nunderstanding of how specific development projects with a broader organizational \\nfocus can be identified and selected. Specifically, we describe corporate strategic plan-\\nning and information systems planning, two processes that can significantly improve \\nthe quality of project identification and selection decisions. This section also outlines \\nthe types of information about business direction and general systems requirements \\nthat can influence selection decisions and guide the direction of approved projects.\\nCorporate Strategic Planning\\nA prerequisite for making effective project selection decisions is to gain a clear idea \\nof where an organization is, its vision of where it wants to be in the future, and how to \\nmake the transition to its desired future state. Figure 4-6 represents this as a three-step \\nprocess. The first step focuses on gaining an understanding of the current enterprise. \\nIn other words, if you don’t know where you are, it is impossible to tell where you are \\ngoing. Next, top management must determine where it wants the enterprise to be in \\nthe future. Finally, after gaining an understanding of the current and future enter-\\nprise, a strategic plan can be developed to guide this transition. The process of devel-\\noping and refining models of the current and future enterprise as well as a transition \\nstrategy is often referred to as corporate strategic planning. During corporate strategic \\nplanning, executives typically develop a mission statement, statements of future cor-\\nporate objectives, and strategies designed to help the organization reach its objectives.\\nAll successful organizations have a mission. The mission statement of a com-\\npany typically states in very simple terms what business the company is in. For ex-\\nample, the mission statement for Pine Valley Furniture (PVF) is shown in Figure 4-7. \\nAfter reviewing PVF’s mission statement, it becomes clear that it is in the business \\nof constructing and selling high-quality wood furniture to the general public, busi-\\nnesses, and institutions such as universities and hospitals. It is also clear that PVF is \\nnot in the business of fabricating steel file cabinets or selling its products through \\nwholesale distributors. Based on this mission statement, you could conclude that \\nPVF does not need a retail sales information system; instead, a high-quality human \\n resource information system would be consistent with its goal.\\nCurrent\\nEnterprise\\nFuture\\nEnterprise\\nStrategic\\nPlan\\nStep 1\\nStep 2\\nStep 3\\nFigure 4-6 \\nCorporate strategic planning \\nis a three-step process\\nCorporate strategic planning\\nAn ongoing process that defines the \\nmission, objectives, and strategies of an \\norganization.\\nMission statement\\nA statement that makes it clear what \\nbusiness a company is in.\\nPine Valley Furniture\\nCorporate Mission Statement\\nWe are in the business of designing, \\nfabricating, and selling to retail stores \\nhigh-quality wood furniture for \\nhousehold, oﬃce, and institutional use.  \\nWe value quality in our products and in \\nour relationships with customers and \\nsuppliers.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\ASUS\\\\Desktop\\\\AI powered chatbot\\\\Data\\\\SAD.pdf', 'page': 120}, page_content='96 Part II   Planning\\nAfter defining its mission, an organization can then define its objectives. \\nObjective statements refer to “broad and timeless” goals for the organization. These \\ngoals can be expressed as a series of statements that are either qualitative or quantita-\\ntive but that typically do not contain details likely to change substantially over time. \\nObjectives are often referred to as critical success factors. Here, we will simply use the \\nterm objectives. The objectives for PVF are shown in Figure 4-8, with most relating to \\nsome aspect of the organizational mission. For example, the second objective relates \\nto how PVF views its relationships with customers. This goal would suggest that PVF \\nmight want to invest in a web-based order tracking system that would contribute to \\nhigh-quality customer service. Once a company has defined its mission and objec-\\ntives, a competitive strategy can be formulated.\\nA competitive strategy is the method by which an organization attempts to \\nachieve its mission and objectives. In essence, the strategy is an organization’s game \\nplan for playing in the competitive business world. In his classic book on competitive \\nstrategy, Michael Porter (1980) defined three generic strategies—low-cost producer, \\nproduct differentiation, and product focus or niche—for reaching corporate objec-\\ntives (see Table 4-3). These generic strategies allow you to more easily compare two \\ncompanies in the same industry that may not employ the same competitive strategy. \\nObjective statements\\nA series of statements that express an \\norganization’s qualitative and quantitative \\ngoals for reaching a desired future position.\\nCompetitive strategy\\nThe method by which an organization \\nattempts to achieve its mission and \\nobjectives.\\nPine Valley Furniture\\nStatement of Objectives\\nPVF will strive to increase market share and proﬁtability (prime objective).\\nPVF will be considered a market leader in customer service.\\nPVF will be innovative in the use of technology to help bring new products \\nto market faster than our competition.\\nPVF will employ the fewest number of the highest-quality people \\nnecessary to accomplish our prime objective.\\nPVF will create an environment that values diversity in gender, race, \\nvalues, and culture among employees, suppliers, and customers.\\n1.\\n2.\\n3.\\n4.\\n5.\\nFigure 4-8 \\nStatement of corporate objectives  \\n(Pine Valley Furniture)\\nTable 4-3  Generic Competitive Strategies\\nStrategy Description\\nLow-Cost Producer This strategy reflects competing in an industry on the basis of product or service cost to the consumer. \\nFor example, in the automobile industry, the South Korean–produced Hyundai is a product line that \\ncompetes on the basis of low cost.\\nProduct Differentiation This competitive strategy reflects capitalizing on a key product criterion requested by the market (for \\nexample, high quality, style, performance, roominess). In the automobile industry, many manufacturers \\nare trying to differentiate their products on the basis of quality (e.g., “At Ford, quality is job one.”).\\nProduct Focus or Niche This strategy is similar to both the low-cost and differentiation strategies but with a much narrower \\nmarket focus. For example, a niche market in the automobile industry is the convertible sports car \\nmarket. Within this market, some manufacturers may employ a low-cost strategy and others may \\nemploy a differentiation strategy based on performance or style.\\n(Source: Based on The Free Press, a Division of Simon & Schuster Adult Publishing Group, from Porter, 1980.

For example, Rolls-Royce and \\nKia Motors are two car lines with different strategies: One is a high-prestige line in \\nthe ultra-luxury niche, whereas the other is a relatively low-priced line for the general \\nautomobile market. Rolls-Royce may build information systems to collect and ana-\\nlyze information on customer satisfaction to help manage a key company objective. \\nAlternatively, Kia may build systems to track plant and material utilization in order to \\nmanage activities related to its low-cost strategy.\\nTo effectively deploy resources such as the creation of a marketing and sales or-\\nganization or to build the most effective information systems, an organization must \\nclearly understand its mission, objectives, and strategy. A lack of understanding will \\nmake it impossible to know which activities are essential to achieving business ob-\\njectives. From an information systems development perspective, by understanding \\nwhich activities are most critical for achieving business objectives, an organization \\nhas a much greater chance to identify those activities that need to be supported by \\ninformation systems. In other words, it is only through the clear understanding of the or-\\nganizational mission, objectives, and strategies that IS development projects should be identi-\\nfied and selected. The process of planning how information systems can be employed \\nto assist organizations to reach their objectives is the focus of the next section.\\nInformation Systems Planning\\nThe second planning process that can play a significant role in the quality of project \\nidentification and selection decisions is called information systems planning (ISP). \\nISP is an orderly means of assessing the information needs of an organization and \\ndefining the information systems, databases, and technologies that will best satisfy \\nthose needs (Amrollahi et al., 2014; Carlson et al., 1989; Cassidy, 2005; Luftman, \\n2004; Overby, 2008; Parker and Benson, 1989; Segars and Grover, 1999; Weill and \\nRoss, 2009). This means that during ISP you (or, more likely, senior IS managers \\nresponsible for the IS plan) must model current and future organization informa-\\ntional needs and develop strategies and project plans to migrate the current infor-\\nmation systems and technologies to their desired future state. ISP is a top-down \\nprocess that takes into account the outside forces—industry, economic, relative \\nsize, geographic region, and so on—that are critical to the success of the firm. This \\nmeans that ISP must look at information systems and technologies in terms of how \\nthey help the business achieve its objectives as defined during corporate strategic \\nplanning.\\nThe three key activities of this modeling process are represented in Figure 4-9. \\nLike corporate strategic planning, ISP is a three-step process in which the first step \\nis to assess current IS-related assets—human resources, data, processes, and tech-\\nnologies. Next, target blueprints of these resources are developed. These blueprints \\nreflect the desired future state of resources needed by the organization to reach its \\nobjectives as defined during strategic planning. Finally, a series of scheduled projects \\nis defined to help move the organization from its current to its future desired state. \\n(Of course, scheduled projects from the ISP process are just one source for projects. \\nOthers include bottom-up requests from managers and business units, such as the \\nSSR in Figure 3-2.)\\nFor example, a project may focus on reconfiguration of a telecommunica-\\ntions network to speed data communications or it may restructure work and data \\nflows between business areas. Projects can include not only the development of new \\ninformation systems or the modification of existing ones, but also the acquisition \\nand management of new systems, technologies, and platforms. These three activi-\\nties parallel those of corporate strategic planning, and this relationship is shown in \\nFigure 4-10. Numerous methodologies such as Business Systems Planning (BSP) and \\nInformation Engineering (IE) have been developed to support the ISP process (see \\ninformation systems  \\nplanning (iSP)\\nAn orderly means of assessing the \\ninformation needs of an organization and \\ndefining the systems, databases, and \\ntechnologies that will best satisfy those \\nneeds.'),\n",

Describe the current situation. The most widely used approach for describing the \\ncurrent organizational situation is generically referred to as top-down planning. \\nTop-down planning attempts to gain a broad understanding of the informational \\nneeds of the entire organization. The approach begins by conducting an exten-\\nsive analysis of the organization’s mission, objectives, and strategy and determin-\\ning the information requirements needed to meet each objective. This approach \\nto ISP implies by its name a high-level organizational perspective with active in-\\nvolvement of top-level management. The top-down approach to ISP has several \\nadvantages over other planning approaches, which are summarized in Table 4-4.\\nTop-down planning\\nA generic ISP methodology that attempts \\nto gain a broad understanding of the \\ninformation systems needs of the entire \\norganization.\\nCurrent Situation:\\n•  listing of manual and automated processes\\n•  listing of manual and automated data\\n•  technology inventory\\n•  human resources inventory\\nFuture Situation:\\n•  blueprints of manual and automated processes\\n•  blueprints of manual and automated data\\n•  technology blueprints\\n•  human resources blueprints\\nSchedule of Projects:\\nStep 1\\nStep 2\\nStep 3\\nFigure 4-9 \\nInformation systems planning is a three-\\nstep process\\nCurrent Situation:\\n•  listing of manual and automated processes\\n•  listing of manual and automated data\\n•  technology inventory\\n•  human resources inventory\\nFuture Situation:\\n•  blueprints of manual and automated processes\\n•  blueprints of manual and automated data\\n•  technology blueprints\\n•  human resources blueprints\\nSchedule of Projects: \\nCorporate Strategic Planning Information Systems Planning\\nCurrent\\nEnterprise\\nFuture\\nEnterprise\\nStrategic\\nPlanFigure 4-10 \\nParallel activities of corporate strategic \\nplanning and information systems \\nplanning'),\n",

Using the bottom-up approach for creating IS plans \\ncan be faster and less costly than using the top-down approach; it also has the \\n advantage of identifying pressing organizational problems.

To gain \\nthis understanding, the team will need to review corporate documents; interview \\nmanagers, executives, and customers; and conduct detailed reviews of competitors, \\nmarkets, products, and finances. The type of information that must be collected to \\nrepresent the current situation includes the identification of all organizational loca-\\ntions, units, functions, processes, data (or data entities), and information systems.\\nWithin PVF, for example, organizational locations would consist of a list of all \\ngeographic areas in which the organization operates (e.g., the locations of the home \\nand branch offices). Organizational units represent a list of people or business units \\nthat operate within the organization. Thus, organizational units would include vice \\npresident of manufacturing, sales manager, salesperson, and clerk. Functions are \\ncross-organizational collections of activities used to perform day-to-day business \\noperations. Examples of business functions might include research and develop-\\nment, employee development, purchasing, and sales. Processes represent a list of \\nmanual or automated procedures designed to support business functions. Exam-\\nples of business processes might include payroll processing, customer billing, and \\nproduct shipping. Data entities represent a list of the information items generated, \\nupdated, deleted, or used within business processes. Information systems represent \\nautomated and nonautomated systems used to transform data into information to \\nsupport business processes. For example, Figure 4-11 shows portions of the business \\nBottom-up planning\\nA generic information systems planning \\nmethodology that identifies and defines IS \\ndevelopment projects based upon solving \\noperational business problems or taking \\nadvantage of some business opportunities.\\nTable 4-4  advantages to the Top-Down Planning approach Over Other Planning approaches\\nAdvantage Description\\nBroader Perspective If not viewed from the top, information systems may be \\nimplemented without first understanding the business from \\ngeneral management’s viewpoint.\\nImproved Integration If not viewed from the top, totally new management information \\nsystems may be implemented rather than planning how to \\nevolve existing systems.\\nImproved Management \\nSupport\\nIf not viewed from the top, planners may lack sufficient \\nmanagement acceptance of the role of information systems in \\nhelping them achieve business objectives.\\nBetter Understanding If not viewed from the top, planners may lack the understanding \\nnecessary to implement information systems across the entire \\nbusiness rather than simply to individual operating units.\\n(Source: Based on IBM, 1982; Slater, 2002; Overby, 2008).\\nFUNCTIONS: DATA ENTITIES: INFORMATION SYSTEMS:\\nbusiness planning customer payroll processing\\nproduct development product accounts payable\\nmarketing and sales vendor accounts receivable\\nproduction operations raw material time card processing\\nﬁnance and accounting order inventory management\\nhuman resources invoice …\\n… equipment\\n… Figure 4-11 \\nInformation systems planning \\ninformation (Pine Valley Furniture)'),\n",

Once high-level informa-\\ntion is collected, each item can typically be decomposed into smaller units as more \\ndetailed planning is performed. Figure 4-12 shows the decomposition of several of \\nPVF’s high-level business functions into more detailed supporting functions.\\nAfter creating these lists, a series of matrices can be developed to cross \\n reference various elements of the organization. The types of matrices typically \\ndeveloped include the following:\\n•\\t Location-to-Function: This matrix identifies which business functions are \\n being performed at various organizational locations.\\n•\\t Location-to-Unit: This matrix identifies which organizational units are  located \\nin or interact with a specific business location.\\n•\\t Unit-to-Function: This matrix identifies the relationships between \\n organizational entities and each business function.\\n•\\t Function-to-Objective: This matrix identifies which functions are essential or \\ndesirable in achieving each organizational objective.\\n•\\t Function-to-Process: This matrix identifies which processes are used to \\n support each business function.\\n•\\t Function-to-Data Entity: This matrix identifies which business functions \\n utilize which data entities.\\n•\\t Process-to-Data Entity: This matrix identifies which data are captured, used, \\nupdated, or deleted within each process.\\n•\\t Process-to-Information System: This matrix identifies which information \\n systems are used to support each process.\\n•\\t Data Entity-to-Information System: This matrix identifies which data are \\n created, updated, accessed, or deleted in each system.\\n•\\t Information System-to-Objective: This matrix identifies which information \\nsystems support each business objective as identified during organizational \\nplanning.\\nFigure 4-12 \\nFunctional decomposition of information \\nsystems planning information (Pine Valley \\nFurniture)\\n(Source: Microsoft Corporation.)'),\n",

For example, Figure 4-13 shows a portion of the Data Entity-\\nto-Function matrix for PVF. The “X” in various cells of the matrix represents \\nwhich business functions utilize which data entities. A more detailed picture of \\ndata utilization would be shown in the Process-to-Data Entity matrix (not shown \\nhere), in which the cells would be coded as “C” for the associated process that \\ncreates or captures data for the associated data entity, “R” for retrieve (or used), \\n“U” for update, and “D” for delete. This means that different matrices can have \\ndifferent relationships depending on what is being represented. Because of this \\nflexibility and ease of representing information, analysts use a broad range of \\nmatrices to gain a clear understanding of an organization’s current situation and \\nto plan for its future (Kerr, 1990). A primer on using matrices for ISP is provided \\nin Figure 4-14.\\n2. Describing the target situation, trends, and constraints. After describing the cur -\\nrent situation, the next step in the ISP process is to define the target situ -\\nation that reflects the desired future state of the organization. This means \\nthat the target situation consists of the desired state of the locations, units, \\nfunctions, processes, data, and IS (see Figure 4-9). For example, if a de-\\nsired future state of the organization is to have several new branch offices \\nor a new product line that requires several new employee positions, func-\\ntions, processes, and data, then most lists and matrices will need to be up-\\ndated to reflect this vision. The target situation must be developed in light \\nof technology and business trends, in addition to organizational constraints. \\nThis means that lists of business trends and constraints should also be con-\\nstructed in order to help ensure that the target situation reflects these \\nissues.\\nIn summary, to create the target situation, planners must first edit their \\ninitial lists and record the desired locations, units, functions, processes, data, \\nand information systems within the constraints and trends of the organization \\nenvironment (e.g., time, resources, technological evolution, competition, and \\nso on). Next, matrices are updated to relate information in a manner consistent \\nwith the desired future state. Planners then focus on the differences between \\nthe current and future lists and matrices to identify projects and transition \\nstrategies.\\nMarketing and Sales\\n Marketing Research\\n Order Fulﬁllment\\n Distribution\\nProduction Operation\\n Production Scheduling\\n F abrication\\n Assembly\\n Finishing\\nFinance and Accounting\\n Capital Budgeting\\n Accounts Receivable\\n Accounts Payable\\n...\\nCustomer Product Vendor Raw\\nMaterial\\nOrder Work\\nCenter\\nEquipment Employees Invoice Work\\nOrder\\n...\\nFigure 4-13 \\nData Entity-to-Function matrix  \\n(Pine Valley Furniture)'),\n",

Developing a transition strategy and plans. Once the creation of the current and \\ntarget situations is complete, a detailed transition strategy and plan are devel-\\noped by the IS planning team. This plan should be very comprehensive, reflect-\\ning broad, long-range issues in addition to providing sufficient detail to guide \\nall levels of management concerning what needs to be done, how, when, and \\nby whom in the organization. The components of a typical information systems \\nplan are outlined in Figure 4-15.\\nThe IS plan is typically a very comprehensive document that looks at both \\nshort- and long-term organizational development needs. The short- and long-term \\ndevelopmental needs identified in the plan are typically expressed as a series of \\nprojects (see Figure 4-16). Projects from the long-term plan tend to build a foun-\\ndation for later projects (such as transforming databases from old technology into \\nnewer technology). Projects from the short-term plan consist of specific steps to \\nfill the gap between current and desired systems or respond to dynamic business \\nconditions. The top-down (or plan-driven) projects join a set of bottom-up or needs-\\ndriven projects submitted as system service requests from managers to form the \\nAffinity clustering\\nThe process of arranging planning matrix \\ninformation so that clusters of information \\nwith a predetermined level or type of \\naffinity are placed next to each other on a \\nmatrix report.\\nDuring the information systems planning process, before individual projects are \\nidentiﬁed and selected, a great deal of “behind the scenes” analysis takes place. \\nDuring this planning period, which can span from six months to a year, IS planning \\nteam members develop and analyze numerous matrices like those described in the \\nassociated text. Matrices are developed to represent the current and the future views \\nof the organization. Matrices of the “current” situation are called “as is” matrices. In \\nother words, they describe the world “as” it currently “is.” Matrices of the target or \\n“future” situation are called “to be” matrices. Contrasting the current and future views \\nprovides insights into the relationships existing in important business information, and \\nmost important, forms the basis for the identiﬁcation and selection of speciﬁc \\ndevelopment projects. Many CASE tools provide features that will help you make \\nsense out of these matrices in at least three ways:\\n1.\\n2.\\n3.\\nManagement of Information. A big part of working with complex matrices is \\nmanaging the information. Using the dictionary features of the CASE tool \\nrepository, terms (such as business functions and process and data entities) can be \\ndeﬁned or modiﬁed in a single location. All planners will therefore have the most \\nrecent information.\\nMatrix Construction. The reporting system within the CASE repository allows \\nmatrix reports to be easily produced. Because planning information can be \\nchanged at any time by many team members, an easy method to record changes \\nand produce the most up-to-date reports is invaluable to the planning process.\\nMatrix Analysis. Possibly the most important feature CASE tools provide to \\nplanners is the ability to perform complex analyses within and across matrices. This \\nanalysis is often referred to as aﬃnity clustering . Aﬃnity refers to the extent to \\nwhich information holds things in common. Thus, aﬃnity clustering is the process \\nof arranging matrix information so that clusters of information with some \\npredetermined level or type of aﬃnity are placed next to each other on a matrix \\nreport. For example, an aﬃnity clustering of a Process-to-Data Entity matrix would \\ncreate roughly a block diagonal matrix with processes that use similar data entities \\nappearing in adjacent rows and data entities used in common by the same \\nprocesses grouped into adjacent columns. This general form of analysis can be \\nused by planners to identify items that often appear together (or should!). Such \\ninformation can be used by planners to most eﬀectively group and relate \\ninformation (e.g., data to processes, functions to locations, and so on). For \\nexample, those data entities used by a common set of processes are candidates \\nfor a speciﬁc database. And those business processes that relate to a strategically \\nimportant objective will likely receive more attention when managers from those \\nareas request system changes.\\nFigure 4-14 \\nMaking sense out of planning matrices'),\n",

Nonetheless, there are some special considerations when \\ndeveloping an Internet-based application. In this section, we highlight some of those \\nissues that relate directly to the process of identifying and selecting Internet-related \\nsystems development projects.\\nInternet Basics\\nThe name Internet is derived from the concept of “internetworking”; that is, con-\\nnecting host computers and their networks to form an even larger, global network. \\nAnd that is essentially what the Internet is—a large, worldwide network of networks \\nthat use a common protocol to communicate with each other. The interconnected \\nnetworks include computers running Windows, Linux, IOS, and many other net-\\nwork and computer types. The Internet stands as the most prominent representation \\nof global networking. Using the Internet to support day-to-day business activities is \\nbroadly referred to as electronic commerce (EC). However, not all Internet EC ap-\\nplications are the same. For example, there are three general classes of Internet EC \\napplications: business-to-consumer (B2C), business-to-business (B2B), and business-\\nto-employee (B2E). Figure 4-17 shows three possible modes of EC using the Internet. \\nB2C refers to business transactions between individual consumers and businesses. \\nB2B refers to business transactions between business partners, such as suppliers and \\nintermediaries. B2E refers to the use of the Internet within the same business to \\nsupport employee development and internal business processes. B2E is sometimes \\nreferred to as an Intranet.\\nB2E and B2B electronic commerce are examples of two ways organizations \\nhave been communicating via technology for years. For example, B2E is a lot like \\nhaving a “global” local area network (LAN). Organizations utilizing B2E capabilities \\nwill select various applications or resources that are located on the Intranet—such \\nas a customer contact database or an inventory-control system—that only members \\nof the organization can access. Likewise, B2Bs use the Internet to provide similar \\ncapabilities to an established computing model, electronic data interchange (EDI). \\nEDI refers to the use of telecommunications technologies to directly transfer busi-\\nness documents between organizations. Using EDI, trading partners (suppliers, \\ninternet\\nA large, worldwide network of \\nnetworks that use a common protocol to \\ncommunicate with each other.\\nelectronic commerce (eC)\\nInternet-based communication to support \\nday-to-day business activities.\\nBusiness-to-consumer (B2C)\\nElectronic commerce between businesses \\nand consumers.\\nBusiness-to-business (B2B)\\nElectronic commerce between business \\npartners, such as suppliers and \\nintermediaries.\\nBusiness-to-employee (B2e)\\nElectronic commerce between businesses \\nand their employees.\\nelectronic data interchange \\n(eDi)\\nThe use of telecommunications technologies \\nto directly transfer business documents \\nbetween organizations.\\nIndividual\\nBusiness-to-Business (B2B)\\nBusiness-to-Employee (B2E)\\nBusiness-to-Consumer (B2C)\\nBusiness Business\\nFigure 4-17 \\nThree possible modes of electronic \\ncommerce'),\n",

For example, a company using EDI may send \\nan electronic purchase order instead of a paper request to a supplier. The paper \\norder may take several days to arrive at the supplier, whereas an EDI purchase order \\nwill only take a few seconds. EDI-type data transfers over the Internet, generally re-\\nferred to as B2B transactions, have become the standard by which organizations com-\\nmunicate with each other in the world of electronic commerce.\\nWhen developing either a B2E or B2B application, developers know who the \\nusers are, what applications will be used, the speed of the network connection, and \\nthe type of communication devices supported (e.g., web browsers such as Firefox or \\nweb-enabled smart phones such as the iPhone). On the other hand, when develop-\\ning an Internet EC application (hereafter, simply EC), there are countless unknowns \\nthat developers have to discern in order to build a useful system. Table 4-5 lists a \\nsample of the numerous unknowns to be dealt with when designing and building an \\nEC  application. These unknowns may result in making trade-offs based on a careful \\nanalysis of who the users are likely to be, where they are likely to be located, and how \\nthey are likely to be connected to the Internet. Even with all these difficulties to con-\\ntend with, there is no shortage of Internet EC applications springing up all across the \\nworld. One company that has decided to get onto the web with its own EC site is PVF.\\nPine valley furniture WebStore\\nThe board of directors of PVF has requested that a project team be created to  explore \\nthe opportunity to develop an EC system. Specifically, market research has found \\nthat there is a good opportunity for online furniture purchases, especially in the fol-\\nlowing areas:\\n•\\t Corporate furniture\\n•\\t Home office furniture\\n•\\t Student furniture\\nThe board wants to incorporate all three target markets into its long-term EC \\nplan, but wants to initially focus on the corporate furniture buying system. Board \\nmembers feel that this segment has the greatest potential to provide an adequate \\nreturn on investment and would be a good building block for moving into the  \\ncustomer-based markets. Because the corporate furniture buying system will be spe-\\ncifically targeted to the business furniture market, it will be easier to define the sys-\\ntem’s operational requirements. Additionally, this EC system should integrate nicely \\nwith two currently existing systems: Purchasing Fulfillment and Customer Tracking. \\nTogether, these attributes make it an ideal candidate for initiating PVF’s web strategy. \\nThroughout the remainder of the book, we will follow the evolution of the WebStore \\nproject until it becomes operational for PVF.\\nTable 4-5   Unknowns That Must be Dealt with When Designing and building Internet  \\napplications\\nUser • Concern: Who is the user?\\n•  Example: Where is the user located?

Project identification and selection consists of \\nthree primary activities: identifying potential develop-\\nment projects, classifying and ranking projects, and select-\\ning projects for development. A variety of organizational \\nmembers or units can be assigned to perform this process, \\nincluding top management, a diverse steering committee, \\nbusiness units and functional managers, the development \\ngroup, or the most senior IS executive. Potential projects \\ncan be evaluated and selected using a broad range of \\n criteria such as value chain analysis, alignment with busi-\\nness strategy, potential benefits, resource availability and \\n requirements, and risks.\\nThe quality of the project identification and selec-\\ntion process can be improved if decisions are guided by \\ncorporate strategic planning and ISP. Corporate strategic \\nplanning is the process of identifying the mission, objec-\\ntives, and strategies of an organization. Crucial in this pro-\\ncess is selecting a competitive strategy that states how the \\norganization plans to achieve its objectives.\\nISP is an orderly means for assessing the information \\nneeds of an organization and defining the systems and da-\\ntabases that will best satisfy those needs. ISP is a top-down \\nprocess that takes into account outside forces that drive \\nthe business and the factors critical to the success of the \\nfirm. ISP evaluates the current inventory of systems and \\nthe desired future state of the organization and its system \\nand then determines which projects are needed to trans-\\nform systems to meet the future needs of the organization.\\nCorporate and IS planning are highly interrelated. \\nConceptually, these relationships can be viewed via various \\nmatrices that show how organizational objectives, locations, \\nunits, functions, processes, data entities, and systems relate \\nto one another. Selected projects will be those viewed to be \\nmost important in supporting the organizational strategy.\\nThe Internet is a global network consisting of thou-\\nsands of interconnected individual networks that communi-\\ncate with each other using a common protocol. Electronic \\ncommerce (EC) refers to the use of the Internet to sup-\\nport day-to-day business activities. Business-to-consumer \\nEC refers to transactions between individual consumers \\nand businesses. Business-to-employee EC refers to the use \\nof the Internet within the same organization. Business-to-\\nbusiness EC refers to the use of the Internet between firms.\\nThe focus of this chapter was to provide you with \\na clearer understanding of how organizations identify \\nand select projects. Improved project identification and \\nselection is needed for the following reasons: the cost \\nof information systems is rising rapidly, systems cannot \\nhandle applications that cross organizational boundaries, \\nsystems often do not address critical organizational objec-\\ntives, data redundancy is often out of control, and system \\nmaintenance costs continue to rise. Thus, effective project \\nidentification and selection is essential if organizations are \\nto realize the greatest benefits from information systems.\\nKey TermS\\n 4.1 Affinity clustering\\n 4.2 Bottom-up planning\\n 4.3 Business-to-business (B2B)\\n 4.4 Business-to-consumer (B2C)\\n 4.5 Business-to-employee (B2E)\\n 4.6 Competitive strategy\\n 4.7 Corporate strategic planning\\n 4.8 Electronic commerce (EC)\\n 4.9 Electronic data interchange (EDI)\\n 4.10 Incremental commitment\\n 4.11 Information systems planning (ISP)\\n 4.12 Internet\\n 4.13 Mission statement\\n 4.14 Objective statements\\n 4.15 Top-down planning\\n 4.16 Value chain analysis\\nMatch each of the key terms above with the definition that best \\nfits it.\\n____ Analyzing an organization’s activities to determine where \\nvalue is added to products and/or services and the costs \\nincurred for doing so.\\n____ A strategy in systems analysis and design in which the proj-\\nect is reviewed after each phase and continuation of the \\nproject is rejustified.\\n____ An ongoing process that defines the mission, objectives, \\nand strategies of an organization.\\n____ A statement that makes it clear what business a company is in.\\n____ A series of statements that express an organization’s quali-\\ntative and quantitative goals for reaching a desired future \\nposition.\\n____ The method by which an organization attempts to achieve \\nits mission and objectives.\\n____ An orderly means of assessing the information needs of \\nan organization and defining the systems, databases, and \\ntechnologies that will best satisfy those needs.\\n____ A generic ISP methodology that attempts to gain a broad \\nunderstanding of the information system needs of the en -\\ntire organization.'),\n",

K. Choi, chief financial officer for Petrie Electronics, \\ncame early to the quarterly IS Steering Committee meet-\\ning. Choi, who was the chair of the committee, took his \\nseat at the head of the big table in the corporate confer-\\nence room. He opened the cover on his tablet PC and \\nlooked at the agenda for the day’s meeting. There were \\nonly a few proposed systems projects to consider to-\\nday. He was familiar with the details of most of them. He \\nbriefly looked over the paperwork for each request. He \\ndidn’t really think there was anything too controversial \\nto be considered today. Most of the requests were pretty \\nroutine and involved upgrades to existing systems. The \\none totally new system being proposed for development \\nwas a customer loyalty system, referred to internally as \\n“No Customer Escapes.”\\nChoi chuckled at the name as he read through the pro-\\nposal documents. “This is something we have needed for \\nsome time,” he thought.\\nAfter about 15 minutes, his administrative assistant,  \\nJulie, came in. “Am I late or are you early?” she asked.\\n“No, you’re not late,” Choi said. “I wanted to come in a \\nlittle early and look over the proposals. I wasn’t able to \\nspend as much time on these yesterday as I wanted.”\\nAs Julie was about to respond, the other members of \\nthe committee started to arrive. First was Ella Whinston, \\nthe chief operating officer. Choi knew that Ella was the \\nchampion for the customer loyalty project. She had talked \\nabout it for years now, it seemed to Choi. One of her peo-\\nple would make the presentation in support of the system. \\nChoi knew she had buy-in on the project from most of \\nthe other members of the c-suite. He also knew that Joe \\nSwanson, Petrie director of IT, supported the project. \\nJoe was away, but his assistant director, Jim Watanabe, \\nwould attend the meeting in his place. Ella had already let \\nit be known that she expected Jim to be the project man-\\nager for the customer loyalty system project. Jim had just \\njoined the company, but he had five years of experience \\nat Broadway Entertainment Company before its spectacu-\\nlar collapse. “Good thing I unloaded all that BEC stock I \\nowned before the company went under,” Choi thought. \\nThat reminded him of the meeting he had later today to \\nplan the annual stockholders’ meeting. “Better not let the \\nsteering committee meeting run too long,” he thought. \\n“I’ve got more important things to do today.”\\nNext to arrive was John Smith, the head of marketing. \\nJohn, who was also a member of the steering committee, \\nhad been with Petrie for most of his career. He had been \\nwith the company longer than anyone else on the steering \\ncommittee.\\nJust then, Jim Watanabe came speeding into the con-\\nference room. He almost ran into John Smith as he sailed \\ninto the room. It looked like he was about to drop his tab-\\nlet and spill his coffee on Smith. Choi chuckled again.\\n“Welcome, everyone,” Choi said. “I think we are all here. \\nYou all have copies of the agenda for this morning’s meet-\\ning. Let’s get started.”\\n“Sorry to interrupt, JK,” Ella said. “Bob Petroski is not \\nhere yet. He will be presenting the proposal on the cus-\\ntomer loyalty system project. I don’t know where he is. \\nMaybe he got held up in traffic.”\\n“The customer loyalty system discussion is the last item \\nwe will discuss today, so we can go ahead with the rest \\nof the agenda. Bob does not need to be here for anything \\nexcept that discussion,” Choi explained.\\nChoi looked around the table once more. “OK, then, \\nlet’s get started. Let’s try to keep to the agenda as much \\nas possible. And let’s watch the clock. I know we are all \\nbusy, but I have a very important meeting this afternoon. \\nJulie, see if you can locate Bob.”\\nCase Questions\\n 4.44 What is an IS steering committee?

The first, project identification and selec-\\ntion, focuses on the activities during which the need for a \\nnew or enhanced system is recognized. This activity does \\nnot deal with a specific project but rather identifies the \\nportfolio of projects to be undertaken by the organiza-\\ntion. Thus, project identification and selection is often \\nthought of as a “preproject” step in the life cycle. This \\nrecognition of potential projects may come as part of a \\nlarger planning process, information systems planning, \\nor from requests from managers and business units. \\nRegardless of how a project is identified and selected, the \\nnext step is to conduct a more detailed assessment during \\nproject initiating and planning. This assessment does not \\nfocus on how the proposed system will operate but rather \\non understanding the scope of a proposed project and \\nits feasibility of completion given the available resources. \\nIt is crucial that organizations understand whether re-\\nsources should be devoted to a project; otherwise, very \\nexpensive mistakes can be made (Laplante, 2006; Nash, \\n2008). Thus, the focus of this chapter is on this process. \\nProject initiation and planning is where projects are ac-\\ncepted for development, rejected, or redirected. This is \\nalso where you, as a systems analyst, begin to play a major \\nrole in the systems development process.\\nIn the next section, the project initiation and plan-\\nning process is briefly reviewed. Numerous techniques for \\nassessing project feasibility are then described. We then \\ndiscuss the process of building the Baseline Project Plan, \\nwhich organizes the information uncovered during feasi-\\nbility analysis. Once this plan is developed, a formal review \\nof the project can be conducted. Yet, before the project \\ncan evolve to the next phase of the systems development \\nlife cycle—analysis—the project plan must be reviewed \\nand accepted. In the final major section of the chapter, we \\nprovide an overview of the project review process.\\nInItIatIng and PlannIng \\nSyStemS develoPment ProjectS\\nA key consideration when conducting project initiation \\nand planning (PIP) is deciding when PIP ends and when \\nanalysis, the next phase of the SDLC, begins. This is a \\nconcern because many activities performed during PIP \\ncould also be completed during analysis. Pressman (2014) \\nspeaks of three important questions that must be consid-\\nered when making this decision on the division between \\nPIP and analysis:\\n1. How much effort should be expended on the project \\ninitiation and planning process?\\n2. Who is responsible for performing the project initia-\\ntion and planning process?\\n3. Why is project initiation and planning such a challeng-\\ning activity?\\nFinding an answer to the first question, how much \\neffort should be expended on the PIP process, is often diffi-\\ncult. Practical experience has found, however, that the time \\n5.3 describe the activities needed to build and review \\nthe baseline project plan, and\\n5.4 describe the activities and participant roles within a \\nstructured walk-through.\\nLearning Objectives\\nAfter studying this chapter, you should be able to\\n5.1 describe the steps involved in the project initiation \\nand planning process,\\n5.2 list and describe various methods for assessing \\nproject feasibility,\\nInitiating and Planning \\nSystems development \\nProjects5\\nchapter \\nIntroduction'),\n",

Proper and insightful project planning, including determining project scope as \\nwell as identifying project activities, can easily reduce time in later project phases. For \\nexample, a careful feasibility analysis that leads to deciding that a project\\xa0is not worth \\npursuing can save a considerable expenditure of resources. The actual amount of time \\nexpended will be affected by the size and complexity of the project as well as by the \\nexperience of your organization in building similar systems. A rule of thumb is that \\nbetween 10 and 20 percent of the entire development effort should be expended on \\nthe PIP study. Thus, you should not be reluctant to spend considerable time in PIP in \\norder to fully understand the motivation for the requested system.\\nFor the second question, who is responsible for performing PIP, most organiza-\\ntions assign an experienced systems analyst, or a team of analysts for large projects, \\nto perform PIP. The analyst will work with the proposed customers (managers and \\nusers) of the system and other technical development staff in preparing the final \\nplan. Experienced analysts working with customers who fully understand their infor-\\nmation services needs should be able to perform PIP without the detailed analysis \\ntypical of the analysis phase of the life cycle. Less-experienced analysts with custom-\\ners who only vaguely understand their needs will likely expend more effort during \\nPIP in order to be certain that the project scope and work plan are feasible.\\nAs to the third question, PIP is viewed as a challenging activity because the \\nobjective of the PIP study is to transform a vague system request document into a \\ntangible project description. This is an open-ended process. The analyst must clearly \\nunderstand the motivation for and objectives of the proposed system. Therefore, \\neffective communication among the systems analyst, users, and management is cru-\\ncial to the creation of a meaningful project plan. Getting all parties to agree on the \\ndirection of a project may be difficult for cross-department projects where different \\nparties have different business objectives. Thus, more complex organizational set-\\ntings for projects will result in more time required for analysis of the current and \\nproposed systems during PIP.\\nIn the remainder of this chapter, we will describe the necessary activities used to \\nanswer these questions. In the next section, we will revisit the project initiation and \\nplanning activities originally outlined in Chapter 3 in the section on “Managing the \\nInformation Systems Project.” This is followed by a brief description of the deliver-\\nables and outcomes from this process.\\nthe ProceSS of InItIatIng and PlannIng  \\nIS develoPment ProjectS\\nAs its name implies, two major activities occur during project initiation and planning \\n(Figure 5-1). Because the steps of the project initiation and planning process were \\nexplained in Chapter 3, our primary focus in this chapter is to describe several tech-\\nniques that are used when performing this process. Therefore, we will only briefly \\nreview the PIP process.\\nProject initiation focuses on activities designed to assist in organizing a team to \\nconduct project planning. During initiation, one or more analysts are assigned to work \\nwith a customer—that is, a member of the business group that requested or will be \\naffected by the project—to establish work standards and communication procedures. \\nExamples of the types of activities performed are shown in Table 5-1. Depending upon \\nthe size, scope, and complexity of the project, some project initiation activities may \\nbe unnecessary or may be very involved. Also, many organizations have established \\nprocedures for assisting with common initiation activities. One key activity of project \\ninitiation is the development of the project charter (defined in Chapter 3).\\nProject planning, the second activity within PIP, is distinct from general \\ninformation systems planning, which focuses on assessing the information systems '),\n",

Project planning is \\nthe process of defining clear, discrete activities and the work needed to complete \\neach activity within a single project. The objective of the project planning pro-\\ncess is the development of a Baseline Project Plan (BPP) and the Project Scope \\nStatement (PSS) (Morris and Sember, 2008). The BPP becomes the foundation for \\nthe remainder of the development project. The PSS produced by the team clearly \\noutlines the objectives and constraints of the project for the customer. As with the \\nproject initiation process, the size, scope, and complexity of a project will dictate \\nthe comprehensiveness of the project planning process and resulting documents. \\nFurther, numerous assumptions about resource availability and potential problems \\nwill have to be made. Analysis of these assumptions and system costs and benefits \\nforms a business case.

The plan reflects the best estimate of the project’s scope, benefits, \\ncosts, risks, and resource requirements given the current understanding of the \\nproject. The BPP specifies detailed project activities for the next life cycle phase— \\nanalysis—and less detail for subsequent project phases (because these depend on the \\nresults of the analysis phase). Similarly, benefits, costs, risks, and resource require-\\nments will become more specific and quantifiable as the project progresses. The BPP \\nis used by the project selection committee to help decide whether the project should \\nbe accepted, redirected, or canceled. If selected, the BPP becomes the foundation \\ndocument for all subsequent SDLC activities; however, it is also expected to evolve as \\nthe project evolves. That is, as new information is learned during subsequent SDLC \\nphases, the baseline plan will be updated. Later in this chapter we describe how to \\nconstruct the BPP.\\nThe Project Scope Statement (PSS) is a short document prepared for the cus-\\ntomer that describes what the project will deliver and outlines all work required to \\ncomplete the project. The PSS ensures that both you and your customer gain a com-\\nmon understanding of the project. It is also a very useful communication tool. The \\nPSS is a very easy document to create because it typically consists of a high-level sum-\\nmary of the BPP information (described later). Depending upon your relationship \\nwith your customer, the role of the PSS may vary. At one extreme, the PSS can be used \\nas the basis of a formal contractual agreement outlining firm deadlines, costs, and \\nspecifications. At the other extreme, the PSS can simply be used as a communication \\nvehicle to outline the current best estimates of what the project will deliver, when it \\nwill be completed, and the resources it may consume. A contract programming or \\nconsulting firm, for example, may establish a very formal relationship with a cus-\\ntomer and use a PSS that is extensive and formal. Alternatively, an internal develop-\\nment group may develop a PSS that is only one to two pages in length and is intended \\nto inform customers rather than to set contractual obligations and deadlines.\\naSSeSSIng Project feaSIbIlIty\\nAll projects are feasible given unlimited resources and infinite time (Pressman, \\n2014). Unfortunately, most projects must be developed within tight budgetary and \\ntime constraints. This means that assessing project feasibility is a required activity for \\nall information systems projects and is a potentially large undertaking. It requires \\nthat you, as a systems analyst, evaluate a wide range of factors. Typically, the relative \\nimportance of these factors will vary from project to project. Although the specifics \\nof a given project will dictate which factors are most important, most feasibility fac-\\ntors are represented by the following categories:\\n•\\t Economic\\n•\\t Technical\\n•\\t Operational\\nProject Scope Statement (PSS)\\nA document prepared for the customer that \\ndescribes what the project will deliver and \\noutlines generally at a high level all work \\nrequired to complete the project.\\nTable 5-2  elements of Project Planning\\n• Describing the Project Scope, Alternatives, and Feasibility\\n• Dividing the Project into Manageable Tasks\\n• Estimating Resources and Creating a Resource Plan\\n• Developing a Preliminary Schedule\\n• Developing a Communication Plan\\n• Determining Project Standards and Procedures\\n• Identifying and Assessing Risk\\n• Creating a Preliminary Budget\\n• Developing the Project Scope Statement\\n• Setting a Baseline Project Plan'),\n",

In the remainder of this \\nsection, we will examine various feasibility issues. We begin by looking at issues \\nrelated to economic feasibility and then demonstrate techniques for conducting this \\nanalysis. This is followed by a discussion of techniques for assessing technical project \\nrisk. Finally, issues not directly associated with economic and technical feasibility, but \\nno less important to ensuring project success, are discussed.\\nTo help you better understand the feasibility assessment process, we will exam-\\nine a project at Pine Valley Furniture (PVF). For this project, a System Service Request \\n(SSR) was submitted by PVF’s Vice President of Marketing Jackie Judson to develop \\na Customer Tracking System (CTS) (Figure 5-2). Jackie feels that this system would \\nallow PVF’s marketing group to better track customer purchase activity and sales \\ntrends. She also feels that, if constructed, the CTS would provide many tangible and \\nintangible benefits to PVF. This project was selected by PVF’s Systems Priority Board \\nfor a project initiation and planning study. During project initiation, Senior Systems \\nAnalyst Jim Woo was assigned to work with Jackie to initiate and plan the project. At \\nthis point in the project, all project initiation activities have been completed. Jackie \\nand Jim are now focusing on project planning activities in order to complete the BPP.\\nassessing economic feasibility\\nThe purpose of assessing economic feasibility is to identify the financial benefits and \\ncosts associated with the development project (Laplante, 2006). Economic feasibility \\nis often referred to as cost–benefit analysis. During project initiation and planning, it \\nwill be impossible for you to precisely define all benefits and costs related to a partic-\\nular project. Yet it is important that you spend adequate time identifying and quan-\\ntifying these items or it will be impossible for you to conduct an adequate economic \\nanalysis and make meaningful comparisons between rival projects. Here we will \\ndescribe typical benefits and costs resulting from the development of an informa-\\ntion system and provide several useful worksheets for recording costs and benefits. \\nAdditionally, several common techniques for making cost–benefit calculations are \\npresented. These worksheets and techniques are used after each SDLC phase as the \\nproject is reviewed in order to decide whether to continue, redirect, or kill a project.\\nDetermining Project Benefits An information system can provide many benefits to \\nan organization. For example, a new or renovated information system can automate \\nmonotonous jobs and reduce errors; provide innovative services to customers and \\nsuppliers; and improve organizational efficiency, speed, flexibility, and morale. In \\ngeneral, the benefits can be viewed as being both tangible and intangible. Tangible \\nbenefits refer to items that can be measured in dollars and with certainty. Examples \\nof tangible benefits might include reduced personnel expenses, lower transaction \\ncosts, or higher profit margins.

Jackie and \\nJim had to establish the values in Figure 5-3 after collecting information from users \\nof the current customer tracking system. They first interviewed the person respon-\\nsible for collecting, entering, and analyzing the accuracy of the current customer \\ntracking data. This person estimated that 10 percent of her time was spent correcting \\ndata entry errors. Given that this person’s salary is $25,000, Jackie and Jim estimated \\nan error-reduction benefit of $2,500. Jackie and Jim also interviewed managers who \\nused the current customer tracking reports. Using this information they were able \\nto estimate other tangible benefits. They learned that cost-reduction or avoidance \\nbenefits could be gained due to better inventory management. Also, increased flex-\\nibility would likely occur from a reduction in the time normally taken to manually \\nreorganize data for different purposes. Further, improvements in management plan-\\nning or control should result from a broader range of analyses in the new system. \\nOverall, this analysis forecasts that benefits from the system would be approximately \\n$50,000 per year.\\nJim and Jackie also identified several intangible benefits of the system. Although \\nthese benefits could not be quantified, they will still be described in the final BPP. \\nIntangible benefits refer to items that cannot be easily measured in dollars or with \\ncertainty. Intangible benefits may have direct organizational benefits, such as the \\nimprovement of employee morale, or they may have broader societal implications, \\nsuch as the reduction of waste creation or resource consumption. Potential tangible \\nbenefits may have to be considered intangible during project initiation and planning \\nbecause you may not be able to quantify them in dollars or with certainty at this stage \\nin the life cycle. During later stages, such intangibles can become tangible benefits as \\nyou better understand the ramifications of the system you are designing. In this case, \\nthe BPP is updated and the business case revised to justify continuation of the project \\nto the next phase. Table 5-3 lists numerous intangible benefits often associated with \\nthe development of an information system. Actual benefits will vary from system to \\nsystem. After determining project benefits, project costs must be identified.\\nDetermining Project Costs Similar to benefits, an information system can have both \\ntangible and intangible costs.

TCO is focused on understand-\\ning not only the total cost of acquisition but also all costs associated with ongoing use \\nand maintenance of a system. Consequently, besides tangible and intangible costs, you \\ncan distinguish IS-related development costs as either one-time or recurring (the \\nsame is true for benefits, although we do not discuss this difference for benefits). \\nOne-time costs refer to those associated with project initiation and development and \\nthe start-up of the system. These costs typically encompass activities such as systems \\ndevelopment, new hardware and software purchases, user training, site preparation, \\nand data or system conversion. When conducting an economic cost–benefit analysis, \\na worksheet should be created for capturing these expenses. For very large projects, \\none-time costs may be staged over one or more years. In these cases, a separate one-\\ntime cost worksheet should be created for each year. This separation will make it \\neasier to perform present value calculations (described later). Recurring costs refer \\nto those costs resulting from the ongoing evolution and use of the system. Examples \\nof these costs typically include the following:\\n•\\t Application software maintenance\\n•\\t Incremental data storage expenses\\n•\\t Incremental communications\\n•\\t New software and hardware leases\\n•\\t Supplies and other expenses (e.g., paper, forms, data center personnel)\\nBoth one-time and recurring costs can consist of items that are fixed or variable \\nin nature. Fixed costs are costs that are billed or incurred at a regular interval and \\nusually at a fixed rate (a facility lease payment). Variable costs are items that vary in \\nrelation to usage (long-distance phone charges).\\nDuring the process of determining project costs, Jim and Jackie identified \\nboth one-time and recurring costs for the project. These costs are summarized in \\nFigures 5-4 and 5-5. These figures show that this project will incur a one-time cost of \\n$42,500 and a recurring cost of $28,500 per year. One-time costs were established by \\ndiscussing the system with Jim’s boss, who felt that the system would require approxi-\\nmately four months to develop (at $5000 per month). To effectively run the new \\nsystem, the marketing department would need to upgrade at least five of its current \\nworkstations (at $3000 each).

Other ongoing \\nexpenses such as increased data storage, communications equipment, and supplies \\nshould also be expected. You should now have an understanding of the types of ben-\\nefit and cost categories associated with an information systems project. It should be \\nclear that there are many potential benefits and costs associated with a given project. \\nAdditionally, because the development and useful life of a system may span several \\nyears, these benefits and costs must be normalized into present-day values in order \\nto perform meaningful cost–benefit comparisons. In the next section, we address the \\nrelationship between time and money.\\nThe Time Value of Money Most techniques used to determine economic feasibility \\nencompass the concept of the time value of money (TVM), which reflects the notion \\nthat money available today is worth more than the same amount tomorrow. As previ-\\nously discussed, the development of an information system has both one-time and \\nrecurring costs. Furthermore, benefits from systems development will likely occur \\nsometime in the future. Because many projects may be competing for the same in-\\nvestment dollars and may have different useful life expectancies, all costs and ben-\\nefits must be viewed in relation to their present value when comparing investment \\noptions.\\nA simple example will help in understanding the TVM. Suppose you want to buy \\na used car from an acquaintance and she asks that you make three payments of $1500 \\nfor three years, beginning next year, for a total of $4500. If she would agree to a single \\nlump-sum payment at the time of sale (and if you had the money!), what amount \\ndo you think she would agree to? Should the single payment be $4500? Should it be \\nmore or less? To answer this question, we must consider the time value of money. \\nMost of us would gladly accept $4500 today rather than three payments of $1500, \\nbecause a dollar today (or $4500 for that matter) is worth more than a dollar tomor-\\nrow or next year, given that money can be invested. The rate at which money can be \\nborrowed or invested is referred to as the cost of capital, and is called the  discount rate \\nfor TVM calculations. Let’s suppose that the seller could put the money received for \\nthe sale of the car in the bank and receive a 10 percent return on her investment. A \\nsimple formula can be used when figuring out the present value of the three $1500 \\npayments:\\nPVn  =   Y  *   1\\n(1  +   i)n\\nTime value of money (TVM)\\nThe concept that money available today \\nis worth more than the same amount \\ntomorrow.\\nDiscount rate\\nThe rate of return used to compute the \\npresent value of future cash flows.\\nPresent value\\nThe current value of a future cash flow.\\nRECURRING COSTS WORKSHEET\\nCustomer Tracking System Project\\nYear 1 through 5\\n$25,000\\n1000\\n2000\\n0\\n500\\n0\\n$28,500\\nA.

Due to the \\nfast pace of the business world, PVF’s System Priority Board feels that the useful life \\nof many information systems may not exceed five years. Therefore, all cost–benefit \\nanalysis calculations will be made using a five-year time horizon as the upper bound-\\nary on all time-related analyses. In addition, the management of PVF has set its cost \\nof capital to be 12 percent (i.e., PVF’s discount rate).

Cell H19 summarizes the NPV of the total \\ncosts from the project. The NPV for the project ($35,003) shows that, overall, ben-\\nefits from the project exceed costs (see cell H22).\\nThe overall return on investment (ROI) for the project is also shown on the work-\\nsheet in cell H25. Because alternative projects will likely have different benefit and cost \\nvalues and, possibly, different life expectancies, the overall ROI value is very useful for \\nmaking project comparisons on an economic basis. Of course, this example shows ROI \\nfor the overall project; an ROI analysis could be calculated for each year of the project.\\nThe last analysis shown in Figure 5-6 is a break-even analysis. The objective of \\nthe break-even analysis is to discover at what point (if ever) benefits equal costs (i.e., \\nwhen breakeven occurs). To conduct this analysis, the NPV of the yearly cash flows \\nare determined. Here, the yearly cash flows are calculated by subtracting both the \\none-time cost and the present values of the recurring costs from the present value of \\nthe yearly benefits. The overall NPV of the cash flow reflects the total cash flows for \\nall preceding years. Examination of line 30 of the worksheet shows that breakeven \\noccurs between years 2 and 3. Because year 3 is the first in which the overall NPV cash \\nflow figure is nonnegative, the identification of what point during the year breakeven \\noccurs can be derived as follows:\\nBreak @ Even Ratio =\\nYearly NPV Cash Flow - Overall NPV Cash Flow\\nYearly NPV Cash Flow\\nUsing data from Figure 5-6,\\nBreak @ Even Ratio = 15,303 - 9139\\n15,303 = .403\\nTherefore, project breakeven occurs at approximately 2.4 years. A graphical \\nrepresentation of this analysis is shown in Figure 5-7. Using the information from the \\neconomic analysis, PVF’s Systems Priority Board will be in a much better position to \\nunderstand the potential economic impact of the CTS. It should be clear from this \\nanalysis that, without such information, it would be virtually impossible to know the \\ncost–benefits of a proposed system and impossible to make an informed decision \\nregarding approval or rejection of the service request.\\nYou can use many techniques to compute a project’s economic feasibility. \\nBecause most information systems have a useful life of more than one year and will \\nBreak-even analysis\\nA type of cost–benefit analysis to identify at \\nwhat point (if ever) benefits equal costs.\\n200\\n150\\n100\\n50\\n0\\nYear\\nProject break-even point\\n0123 45\\nBeneﬁts\\nCosts\\nDollars (in thousands)\\nFigure 5-7 \\nBreak-even analysis for Customer \\nTracking System (Pine Valley Furniture)'),\n",

Some of these cost–\\nbenefit analysis techniques are quite simple, whereas others are more sophisticated. \\nTable 5-6 describes three commonly used techniques for conducting economic \\nfeasibility analysis. For a more detailed discussion of TVM or cost–benefit analysis \\ntechniques in general, the interested reader is encouraged to review an introductory \\nfinance or managerial accounting textbook.\\nA systems project, to be approved for continuation, may not have to achieve \\nbreakeven or have an ROI above some organizational threshold, as estimated dur -\\ning project initiation and planning. Because you may not be able to quantify many \\nbenefits or costs at this point in a project, such financial hurdles for a project may \\nbe unattainable. In this case, simply doing as thorough an economic analysis as pos-\\nsible, including producing a long list of intangibles, may be sufficient for the proj-\\nect to progress. One other option is to run the type of economic analysis shown in \\nFigure 5-7 using pessimistic, optimistic, and expected benefit and cost estimates dur-\\ning project initiation and planning. This range of possible outcomes, along with the \\nlist of intangible benefits and the support of the requesting business unit, will often \\nbe enough to allow the project to continue to the analysis phase. You must, however, \\nbe as precise as you can with the economic analysis, especially when investment capi-\\ntal is scarce. In this case, it may be necessary to conduct some typical analysis phase \\nactivities during project initiation and planning in order to clearly identify inefficien-\\ncies and shortcomings with the existing system and to explain how a new system will \\novercome these problems. Thus, building the economic case for a systems project \\nis an open-ended activity; how much analysis is needed depends on the particular \\nproject, stakeholders, and business conditions. Also, conducting economic feasibility \\nanalyses for new types of information systems is often very difficult.\\nassessing technical feasibility\\nThe purpose of assessing technical feasibility is to gain an understanding of the orga-\\nnization’s ability to construct the proposed system. This analysis should include an as-\\nsessment of the development group’s understanding of the possible target hardware, \\nsoftware, and operating environments to be used, as well as system size, complexity, \\nand the group’s experience with similar systems. In this section, we will discuss a \\nframework you can use for assessing the technical feasibility of a project in which a \\nlevel of project risk can be determined after answering a few fundamental questions.\\nIt is important to note that all projects have risk and that risk is not necessarily \\nsomething to avoid. Yet it is also true that, because organizations typically expect a \\ngreater return on their investment for riskier projects, understanding the sources \\nand types of technical risks proves to be a valuable tool when you assess a project. \\nAlso, risks need to be managed in order to be minimized; you should, therefore, \\nTechnical feasibility\\nA process of assessing the development \\norganization’s ability to construct a \\nproposed system.\\nTable 5-6  Commonly Used economic Cost–benefit analysis Techniques\\nAnalysis Technique Description\\nNet Present Value (NPV) NPV uses a discount rate determined from the company’s cost of \\ncapital to establish the present value of a project.

The potential consequences of \\nnot assessing and managing risks can include the following:\\n•\\t Failure to attain expected benefits from the project\\n•\\t Inaccurate project cost estimates\\n•\\t Inaccurate project duration estimates\\n•\\t Failure to achieve adequate system performance levels\\n•\\t Failure to adequately integrate the new system with existing hardware, software, \\nor organizational procedures\\nYou can manage risk on a project by changing the project plan to avoid risky fac-\\ntors, assigning project team members to carefully manage the risky aspects, and set-\\nting up monitoring methods to determine whether or not potential risk is, in fact, \\nmaterializing.\\nThe amount of technical risk associated with a given project is contingent on \\nfour primary factors: project size, project structure, the development group’s expe-\\nrience with the application and technology area, and the user group’s experience \\nwith systems development projects and the application area (see also Kirsch, 2000). \\nAspects of each of these risk areas are summarized in Table 5-7. When using these \\nfactors for conducting a technical risk assessment, four general rules emerge:\\n1. Large projects are riskier than small projects. Project size, of course, relates to the \\nrelative project size with which the development group typically works. A “small” \\nproject for one development group may be relatively “large” for another. The \\ntypes of factors that influence project size are listed in Table 5-7.\\n2. A system in which the requirements are easily obtained and highly structured will be less \\nrisky than one in which requirements are messy, ill-structured, ill-defined, or subject to the \\njudgment of an individual. For example, the development of a payroll system has \\nrequirements that may be easy to obtain due to legal reporting requirements \\nand standard accounting procedures. On the other hand, the development of an \\nexecutive support system would need to be customized to the particular execu-\\ntive decision style and critical success factors of the organization, thus making its \\ndevelopment more risky (see Table 5-7).\\nTable 5-7  Project Risk assessment Factors\\nRisk Factor Examples\\nProject Size Number of members on the project team\\nProject duration time\\nNumber of organizational departments involved in project\\nSize of programming effort (e.g., hours, function points)\\nNumber of outsourcing partners\\nProject Structure New system or renovation of existing system(s)\\nOrganizational, procedural, structural, or personnel changes \\nresulting from system\\nUser perceptions and willingness to participate in effort\\nManagement commitment to system\\nAmount of user information in system development effort\\nDevelopment Group Familiarity with target hardware, software development \\nenvironment, tools, and operating system\\nFamiliarity with proposed application area\\nFamiliarity with building similar systems of similar size\\nUser Group Familiarity with information systems development process\\nFamiliarity with proposed application area\\nFamiliarity with using similar systems\\n(Source: Based on Applegate, Austin, and Soule, 2009; Tech Republic, 2005.)'),\n",

The development of a system employing commonly used or standard technology will be less \\nrisky than one employing novel or nonstandard technology. A project has a greater like-\\nlihood of experiencing unforeseen technical problems when the development \\ngroup lacks knowledge related to an aspect of the technology environment. A less \\nrisky approach is to use standard development tools and hardware environments. \\nIt is not uncommon for experienced system developers to talk of the difficulty of \\nusing leading-edge (or in their words, bleeding-edge) technology (see Table 5-7).\\n4. A project is less risky when the user group is familiar with the systems development pro -\\ncess and application area than if the user group is unfamiliar with them. Successful IS \\nprojects require active involvement and cooperation between the user and devel-\\nopment groups. Users familiar with the application area and the systems develop-\\nment process are more likely to understand the need for their involvement and \\nhow this involvement can influence the success of the project (see Table 5-7).\\nA project with high risk may still be conducted. Many organizations look at risk \\nas a portfolio issue: Considering all projects, it is okay to have a reasonable percent-\\nage of high-, medium-, and low-risk projects. Given that some high-risk projects will \\nget into trouble, an organization cannot afford to have too many of these. Having too \\nmany low-risk projects may not be aggressive enough to make major breakthroughs \\nin innovative uses of systems. Each organization must decide on its acceptable mix of \\nprojects of varying risk.\\nA matrix for assessing the relative risks related to the general rules just described \\nis shown in Figure 5-8. Using the risk factor rules to assess the technical risk level of \\nthe CTS, Jim and Jackie concluded the following about their project:\\n1. The project is a relatively small project for PVF’s development organization. The \\nbasic data for the system are readily available, so the creation of the system will \\nnot be a large undertaking.\\n2.

These nonfinancial and nontechnical issues are \\ndescribed in the following section.\\nassessing other feasibility concerns\\nIn this section, we will briefly conclude our discussion of project feasibility issues by \\nreviewing other forms of feasibility that you may need to consider when formulating \\nthe business case for a system during project planning.\\nAssessing Operational Feasibility The first relates to examining the likelihood that \\nthe project will attain its desired objectives, called operational feasibility. Its purpose \\nis to gain an understanding of the degree to which the proposed system will likely \\nsolve the business problems or take advantage of the opportunities outlined in the \\nSystem Service Request or project identification study. For a project motivated from \\ninformation systems planning, operational feasibility includes justifying the project \\non the basis of being consistent with or necessary for accomplishing the information \\nsystems plan. In fact, the business case for any project can be enhanced by showing \\na link to the business or information systems plan. Your assessment of operational \\nfeasibility should also include an analysis of how the proposed system will affect orga-\\nnizational structures and procedures. Systems that have substantial and widespread \\nimpact on an organization’s structure or procedures are typically riskier projects to \\nundertake. Thus, it is important for you to have a clear understanding of how an \\ninformation system will fit into the current day-to-day operations of the organization.\\nAssessing Schedule Feasibility  Another feasibility concern relates to project du-\\nration and is referred to as assessing schedule feasibility. The purpose of assessing \\nschedule feasibility is for you, as a systems analyst, to gain an understanding of the \\nlikelihood that all potential time frames and completion date schedules can be met \\nand that meeting these dates will be sufficient for dealing with the needs of the  \\norganization. For example, a system may have to be operational by a government-\\nimposed deadline, by a particular point in the business cycle (such as the beginning \\nof the season when new products are introduced), or at least by the time a competi-\\ntor is expected to introduce a similar system. Further, detailed activities may only be \\nfeasible if resources are available when called for in the schedule. For example, the \\nschedule should not call for system testing during rushed business periods or for key \\nproject meetings during annual vacation or holiday periods. The schedule of activi-\\nties produced during project initiation and planning will be very precise and detailed \\nfor the analysis phase. The estimated activities and associated times for activities after \\nthe analysis phase are typically not as detailed (e.g., it will take two weeks to program \\nthe payroll report module) but are rather at the life-cycle-phase level (e.g., it will take \\nsix weeks for physical design, four months for programming, and so on). This means \\nthat assessing schedule feasibility during project initiation and planning is more of a \\n“rough-cut” analysis of whether the system can be completed within the constraints \\nof the business opportunity or the desires of the users. While assessing schedule fea-\\nsibility you should also evaluate scheduling trade-offs. For example, factors such as \\nproject team size, availability of key personnel, subcontracting or outsourcing activi-\\nties, and changes in development environments may all be considered as having a \\npossible impact on the eventual schedule. As with all forms of feasibility, schedule \\nfeasibility will be reassessed after each phase when you can specify with greater cer-\\ntainty the details of each step for the next phase.\\nAssessing Legal and Contractual Feasibility  A third concern relates to assessing \\nlegal and contractual feasibility issues. In this area, you need to gain an understand-\\ning of any potential legal ramifications due to the construction of the system. Possible \\nconsiderations might include copyright or nondisclosure infringements, labor laws, \\nOperational feasibility\\nThe process of assessing the degree to \\nwhich a proposed system solves business \\nproblems or takes advantage of business \\nopportunities.\\nSchedule feasibility\\nThe process of assessing the degree \\nto which the potential time frame and \\ncompletion dates for all major activities \\nwithin a project meet organizational \\ndeadlines and constraints for affecting \\nchange.\\nLegal and contractual \\nfeasibility\\nThe process of assessing potential legal \\nand contractual ramifications due to the \\nconstruction of a system.'),\n",

Contractual obligations may involve own-\\nership of software used in joint ventures, license agreements for use of hardware or \\nsoftware, nondisclosure agreements with partners, or elements of a labor agreement \\n(e.g., a union agreement may preclude certain compensation or work-monitoring \\ncapabilities a user may want in a system). A common situation is that development of \\na new application system for use on new computers may require new or expanded, \\nand more costly, system software licenses. Typically, legal and contractual feasibility is \\na greater consideration if your organization has historically used an outside organiza-\\ntion for specific systems or services that you now are considering handling yourself. \\nIn this case, ownership of program source code by another party may make it difficult \\nto extend an existing system or link a new system with an existing purchased system.\\nAssessing Political Feasibility  A final feasibility concern focuses on assessing \\n political feasibility in which you attempt to gain an understanding of how key stake-\\nholders within the organization view the proposed system. Because an information \\nsystem may affect the distribution of information within the organization, and thus \\nthe distribution of power, the construction of an information system can have politi-\\ncal ramifications. Those stakeholders not supporting the project may take steps to \\nblock, disrupt, or change the intended focus of the project.\\nIn summary, depending upon the given situation, numerous feasibility issues \\nmust be considered when planning a project. This analysis should consider economic, \\ntechnical, operational, schedule, legal, contractual, and political issues related to the \\nproject. In addition to these considerations, project selection by an organization may \\nbe influenced by issues beyond those discussed here. For example, projects may be \\nselected for construction despite high project costs and high technical risk if the \\nsystem is viewed as a strategic necessity; that is, the organization views the project as \\nbeing critical to the organization’s survival. Alternatively, projects may be selected \\nbecause they are deemed to require few resources and have little risk. Projects may \\nalso be selected due to the power or persuasiveness of the manager proposing the \\nsystem. This means that project selection may be influenced by factors beyond those \\ndiscussed here and beyond items that can be analyzed. Understanding the reality \\nthat projects may be selected based on factors beyond analysis, your role as a systems \\nanalyst is to provide a thorough examination of the items that can be assessed. Your \\nanalysis will ensure that a project review committee has as much information as pos-\\nsible when making project approval decisions. In the next section, we discuss how \\nproject plans are typically reviewed.\\nbuIldIng and revIewIng the baSelIne \\nProject Plan\\nAll the information collected during project initiation and planning is collected \\nand organized into a document called the Baseline Project Plan. Once the BPP is \\ncompleted, a formal review of the project can be conducted with project clients and \\nother interested parties.

The focus of this review is to verify all information and assumptions in the \\nbaseline plan before moving ahead with the project.\\nbuilding the baseline Project Plan\\nAs mentioned previously, the project size and organizational standards will dictate \\nthe comprehensiveness of the project initiation and planning process as well as the \\nBPP.

The entire Introduction section is often limited to \\nonly a few pages. Although the Introduction section is sequenced as the first section \\nof the BPP, it is often the final section to be written. It is only after performing most \\nof the project planning activities that a clear overview and recommendation can be \\ncreated. One activity that should be performed initially is the definition of project \\nscope.\\nWhen defining scope for the CTS within PVF, Jim Woo first needed to gain a \\nclear understanding of the project’s objectives. To do this, Jim briefly interviewed \\nJackie Judson and several of her colleagues to gain a clear idea of their needs. He \\nalso spent a few hours reviewing the existing system’s functionality, processes, and \\ndata use requirements for performing customer tracking activities. These activities \\nprovided him with the information needed to define the project scope and to iden-\\ntify possible alternative solutions. Alternative system solutions can relate to different \\nsystem scopes, platforms for deployment, or approaches to acquiring the system. We \\nelaborate on the idea of alternative solutions, called design strategies, when we discuss \\nthe analysis phase of the life cycle. During project initiation and planning, the most \\ncrucial element of the design strategy is the system’s scope. In sum, a determination \\nof scope will depend on the following factors:\\n•\\t Which organizational units (business functions and divisions) might be affected \\nby or use the proposed system or system change?\\n•\\t With which current systems might the proposed system need to interact or be \\nconsistent, or which current systems might be changed due to a replacement \\nsystem?\\n•\\t Who inside and outside the requesting organization (or the organization as a \\nwhole) might care about the proposed system?\\n•\\t What range of potential system capabilities will be considered?\\nThe Project Scope Statement for the CTS project is shown in Figure 5-10.\\nFor the CTS, project scope was defined using only textual information. It is \\nnot uncommon, however, to define project scope using diagrams such as data flow \\ndiagrams and entity-relationship models. For example, Figure 5-11 shows a context-\\nlevel data flow diagram used to define system scope for PVF’s Purchasing Fulfillment \\nSystem. The other items in the Introduction section of the BPP are simply executive \\nsummaries of the other sections of the document.\\nThe System Description Section of the Baseline Project Plan The second section of \\nthe BPP is the System Description, which contains an outline of possible alternative so-\\nlutions in addition to the one deemed most appropriate for the given situation. Note \\nthat this description is at a very high level and mostly narrative in form. The following \\nexamples demonstrate that alternatives may be stated simply:\\n1. Web-based online system\\n2. Mainframe with central database\\n3. Local area network with decentralized databases\\n4. Batch data input with online retrieval\\n5. Purchasing of a prewritten package\\nIf the project is approved for construction or purchase, you will need to collect \\nand structure information in a more detailed and rigorous manner during the analy-\\nsis phase and evaluate in greater depth these and other alternative directions for the \\nsystem. At this point in the project, your objective is only to identify the most obvious \\nalternative solutions.\\nWhen Jim and Jackie were considering system alternatives for the CTS, they \\nfocused on two primary issues. First, they discussed how the system would be \\nacquired and considered three options: purchase the system if one could be found \\nthat met PVF’s needs, outsource the development of the system to an outside orga-\\nnization, or build the system within PVF. The second issue focused on defining the '),\n",

To complete this task, Jim asked \\nJackie to write a series of statements listing the types of tasks that she envisioned \\nmarketing personnel would be able to accomplish when using the CTS. This list \\nof statements became the basis of the system description and was instrumental in \\nhelping them make their acquisition decision. After considering the unique needs \\nof the marketing group, both decided that the best decision was to build the system \\nwithin PVF.\\nGeneral Project Information\\nProblem/Opportunity Statement:\\nProject Objectives:\\nProject Description:\\nBusiness Beneﬁts:\\nProject Deliverables:\\nEstimated Project Duration:\\nProject Name:\\nSponsor:\\nProject Manager:\\nCustomer Tracking System\\nJackie Judson, VP Marketing\\nJim Woo\\nPine Valley Furniture\\nProject Scope Statement \\nSales growth has outpaced the Marketing department’s ability to accurately track and \\nforecast customer buying trends.

This is also the section where high-\\nlevel project schedules are specified using network diagrams and Gantt charts. Recall \\nfrom Chapter 3 that this process is referred to as a work breakdown structure. During \\nproject initiation and planning, task and activity estimates are not generally detailed. \\nAn accurate work breakdown can be done only for the next one or two life cycle ac-\\ntivities. After defining the primary tasks for the project, an estimate of the resource \\nrequirements can be made. As with defining tasks and activities, this activity is pri-\\nmarily concerned with gaining rough estimates of the human resource requirements \\nbecause people are the most expensive resource element. Once you define the major \\ntasks and resource requirements, a preliminary schedule can be developed. Defining \\nan acceptable schedule may require that you find additional or different resources \\nor that you change the scope of the project. The greatest amount of project planning \\neffort is typically expended on these Feasibility Assessment activities.\\nThe Management Issues Section of the Baseline Project Plan  The final section, \\nManagement Issues, outlines a number of managerial concerns related to the project. \\nThis will be a very short section if the proposed project is going to be conducted \\nexactly as prescribed by the organization’s standard systems development methodol-\\nogy. Most projects, however, have some unique characteristics that require minor to \\nmajor deviation from the standard methodology. In the Team Configuration and \\nManagement portion, you identify the types of people to work on the project, who \\nwill be responsible for which tasks, and how work will be supervised and reviewed \\n(Figure 5-12). In the Communications Plan portion, you explain how the user will \\nbe kept informed about project progress (such as periodic review meetings or even a \\nnewsletter) and what mechanisms will be used to foster sharing of ideas among team \\nmembers, such as some form of computer-based conference facility (Figure 5-13). \\nAn example of the type of information contained in the Project Standards and \\nProcedures portion would be procedures for submitting and approving project \\nchange requests and any other issues deemed important for the project’s success.\\nYou should now have a feel for how a BPP is constructed and the types of \\ninformation it contains. Its creation is not meant to be a project in and of itself, but \\nrather a step in the overall systems development process. Developing the BPP has \\ntwo primary objectives. First, it helps to ensure that the customer and development \\ngroup share a common understanding of the project. Second, it helps to provide the \\nsponsoring organization with a clear idea of the scope, benefits, and duration of the \\nproject.\\nPrice & Terms Quotes\\nShipment\\nRequest for Quotes\\nOrder\\nSupplier Material Evaluation\\nMaterial Speciﬁcations\\nProduction Schedules\\nProduction Capacities\\nMaterial Availability\\nSupplier Material\\nSpeciﬁcations\\n0\\nPurchasing\\nFulﬁllment\\nSystem\\nSuppliers\\nEngineeringProduction\\nSchedulers\\nFigure 5-11 \\nContext-level data flow diagram showing \\nproject scope for Purchasing Fulfillment \\nSystem (Pine Valley Furniture)'),\n",

This review \\ntakes place before the BPP is submitted or presented to a project approval body, such \\nas an IS steering committee or the person who must fund the project. The objective \\nof this review is to ensure that the proposed system conforms to organizational stan-\\ndards and that all relevant parties understand and agree with the information con-\\ntained in the BPP. A common method for performing this review (as well as reviews \\nduring subsequent life cycle phases) is called a structured walk-through. Walk-throughs \\nare peer group reviews of any product created during the systems development pro-\\ncess and are widely used by professional development organizations. Experience has \\nshown that walk-throughs are a very effective way to ensure the quality of an informa-\\ntion system and have become a common day-to-day activity for many systems analysts.\\nMost walk-throughs are not rigidly formal or exceedingly long in duration.

These \\nroles are as follows (Yourdon, 1989):\\n•\\t Coordinator. This person plans the meeting and facilitates a smooth meeting \\nprocess. This person may be the project leader or a lead analyst responsible for \\nthe current life cycle step.\\n•\\t Presenter. This person describes the work product to the group. The presenter is \\nusually an analyst who has done all or some of the work being presented.\\n•\\t User. This person (or group) makes sure that the work product meets the needs \\nof the project’s customers. This user would usually be someone not on the \\nproject team.\\n•\\t Secretary. This person takes notes and records decisions or recommendations \\nmade by the group. This may be a clerk assigned to the project team or it may \\nbe one of the analysts on the team.\\n•\\t Standards bearer. The role of this person is to ensure that the work product \\nadheres to organizational technical standards. Many larger organizations have \\nstaff groups within the unit responsible for establishing standard procedures, \\nmethods, and documentation formats. These standards bearers validate the \\nwork so that it can be used by others in the development organization.\\n•\\t Maintenance oracle. This person reviews the work product in terms of future \\nmaintenance activities. The goal is to make the system and its documentation \\neasy to maintain.\\nAfter Jim and Jackie completed their BPP for the CTS, Jim approached his boss \\nand requested that a walk-through meeting be scheduled and that a walk-through \\ncoordinator be assigned to the project. PVF assists the coordinator by providing a \\nWalk-through Review Form, shown in Figure 5-14. Using this form, the coordina-\\ntor can more easily make sure that a qualified individual is assigned to each walk-\\nthrough role; that each member has been given a copy of the review materials; and \\nthat each member knows the agenda, date, time, and location of the meeting. At the \\nmeeting, Jim presented the BPP and Jackie added comments from a user’s perspec-\\ntive. Once the walk-through presentation was completed, the coordinator polled \\neach representative for his or her recommendation concerning the work product. \\nThe results of this voting may result in validation of the work product, validation \\npending changes suggested during the meeting, or a suggestion that the work prod-\\nuct requires major revision before being presented for approval. In this latter case, \\nsubstantial changes to the work product are usually requested, after which another \\nwalk-through must be scheduled before the project can be proposed to the Systems \\nPriority Board (steering committee). In the case of the CTS, the BPP was supported \\nby the walk-through panel, pending some minor changes to the duration estimates \\nin the schedule. These suggested changes were recorded by the secretary on a Walk-\\nthrough Action List (see Figure 5-15) and given to Jim to incorporate into a final \\nversion of the baseline plan to be presented to the steering committee.\\nAs suggested by the previous discussion, walk-through meetings are a common \\noccurrence in most systems development groups and can be used for more activities \\nthan reviewing the BPP, including the following:\\n•\\t System specifications\\n•\\t Logical and physical designs\\n•\\t Code or program segments\\n•\\t Test procedures and results\\n•\\t Manuals and documentation\\nOne of the key advantages in using a structured review process is it ensures \\nthat formal review points occur during the project. At each subsequent phase of the \\nproject, a formal review should be conducted (and shown on the project schedule) \\nto make sure all aspects of the project are satisfactorily accomplished before assign-\\ning additional resources to the project. This conservative approach of reviewing each \\nmajor project activity with continuation contingent on successful completion of the '),\n",

Your presentation should be designed with a particular objective in mind.\\nWhat is the presentation \\nenvironment?\\nKnowledge of the room size, shape, and lighting is valuable information for designing an optimal \\npresentation.\\nPresentation Design\\nOrganize the sequence. Organize your presentation so that like elements or topics are found in one place, instead of scattered \\nthroughout the material in random fashion.\\nKeep it simple. Make sure that you don’t pack too much information onto a slide so that it is difficult to read. Also, work to \\nhave as few slides as possible; in other words, only include information that you absolutely need.\\nBe consistent. Make sure that you are consistent in the types of fonts, font sizes, colors, design approach, and \\nbackgrounds.\\nUse variety. Use both textual and graphical slides to convey information in the most meaningful format.\\nDon’t rely on the spell \\nchecker alone.\\nMake sure you carefully review your presentation for typographical and wording errors.\\nUse bells and whistles \\nsparingly.\\nMake sure that you use familiar graphical icons to guide and enhance slides; don’t lose sight of your \\nmessage as you add bells and whistles. Also, take great care when making transitions between slides and \\nelements so that “special effects” don’t take away from your message.\\nUse supplemental materials \\nappropriately.\\nTake care when using supplemental materials so that they don’t distract the audience.

Your appearance and demeanor can go a long way toward enhancing how the audience receives your \\npresentation.\\nprior phase is called incremental commitment. It is much easier to stop or redirect a \\nproject at any point when using this approach.\\nWalk-throughs are used throughout the duration of the project for briefing \\nteam members and external stakeholders. These presentations can provide many \\nbenefits to the team, but, unfortunately, are often not well done. With the prolif-\\neration of computer technology and the availability of powerful software to assist in \\ndesigning and delivering presentations, making an effective presentation has never \\nbeen easier. Microsoft’s PowerPoint has emerged as the de facto standard for creating \\ncomputer-based presentations. Although this program is relatively easy to use, it can \\nalso be misused such that the “bells and whistles” added to a computer-based pre-\\nsentation actually detract from the presentation. Like any project, to make an effec-\\ntive presentation it must be well-planned, well-designed, and well-delivered. Planning \\nand designing your presentation is equally important as delivering it. If your slides \\nare poorly laid out, hard to read, or inconsistent, it won’t matter how good your deliv-\\nery is; your audience will think more about the poor quality of the slides than about \\nwhat you are saying. Fortunately, with a little work it is easy to design a high-quality \\npresentation if you follow a few simple steps, which are outlined in Table 5-8.'),\n",

It is at this point that proj-\\nects are accepted for development, rejected as infeasible, \\nor redirected. The objective of this process is to transform \\na vague system request into a tangible system description \\nclearly outlining the objectives, feasibility issues, benefits, \\ncosts, and time schedules for the project.\\nProject initiation includes forming the project initia-\\ntion team, establishing customer relationships, developing \\na plan to get the project started, setting project manage-\\nment procedures, and creating an overall project manage-\\nment environment. A key activity in project planning is the \\nassessment of numerous feasibility issues associated with \\nthe project. The types of feasibility that should be exam-\\nined include economic, technical, operational, schedule, \\nlegal and contractual, and political. These issues are influ-\\nenced by the project size, the type of system proposed, and \\nthe collective experience of the development group and \\npotential customers of the system. High project costs and \\nrisks are not necessarily bad; rather it is more important  \\nthat the organization understands the costs and risks asso-\\nciated with a project and with the portfolio of active proj-\\nects before proceeding.\\nAfter completing all analyses, a BPP can be created. \\nA BPP includes a high-level description of the proposed \\nsystem or system change, an outline of the various feasi-\\nbilities, and an overview of management issues specific to \\nthe project. Before the development of an information sys-\\ntem can begin, the users, management, and development \\ngroup must review and agree on this specification. The \\nfocus of this walk-through review is to assess the merits of \\nthe project and to ensure that the project, if accepted for \\ndevelopment, conforms to organizational standards and \\ngoals. An objective of this process is also to make sure that \\nall relevant parties understand and agree with the infor-\\nmation contained in the plan before subsequent develop-\\nment activities begin.\\nProject initiation and planning is a challenging and \\ntime-consuming activity that requires active involvement \\nfrom many organizational participants. The eventual suc-\\ncess of a development project, and the information systems \\nfunction in general, hinges on the effective use of disci-\\nplined, rational approaches such as the techniques outlined \\nin this chapter. In subsequent chapters, you will be exposed \\nto numerous other tools that will equip you to become an \\neffective designer and developer of information systems.\\nKey TermS\\n 5.1 Baseline Project Plan (BPP)\\n 5.2 Break-even analysis\\n 5.3 Business case\\n 5.4 Discount rate\\n 5.5 Economic feasibility\\n 5.6 Intangible benefit\\n 5.7 Intangible cost\\n 5.8 Legal and contractual feasibility\\n 5.9 One-time cost\\n 5.10 Operational feasibility\\n 5.11 Political feasibility\\n 5.12 Present value\\n 5.13 Project Scope Statement (PSS)\\n 5.14 Recurring cost\\n 5.15 Schedule feasibility\\n 5.16 Total cost of ownership (TCO)\\n 5.17 Tangible benefit\\n 5.18 Tangible cost\\n 5.19 Technical feasibility\\n 5.20 Time value of money (TVM)\\n 5.21 Total cost of ownership (TCO)\\n 5.22 Walk-through\\nMatch each of the key terms above with the definition that best \\nfits it.\\n____ The concept that money available today is worth more \\nthan the same amount tomorrow.\\n____ The process of evaluating how key stakeholders within the \\norganization view the proposed system.\\n____ A document prepared for the customer that describes \\nwhat the project will deliver and outlines generally at a \\nhigh level all work required to complete the project.\\n____ The justification for an information system, presented in \\nterms of the tangible and intangible economic benefits \\nand costs, and the technical and organizational feasibility \\nof the proposed system.\\n____ A process of identifying the financial benefits and costs as-\\nsociated with a development project.\\n____ The process of assessing the degree to which a proposed \\nsystem solves business problems or takes advantage of busi-\\nness opportunities.\\n____ A cost resulting from the ongoing evolution and use of a \\nsystem.\\n____  The rate of return used to compute the present value of \\nfuture cash flows.\\n____ A benefit derived from the creation of an information system \\nthat cannot be easily measured in dollars or with certainty.\\n____ The process of assessing the degree to which the potential \\ntime frame and completion dates for all major activities \\nwithin a project meet organizational deadlines and con-\\nstraints for affecting change.\\n____ A cost associated with an information system that can be \\neasily measured in dollars and with certainty.'),\n",

Systems analysis involves a substantial \\namount of effort and cost, and is therefore undertaken \\nonly after management has decided that the systems de-\\nvelopment project under consideration has merit and \\nshould be pursued through this phase. The analysis team \\nshould not take the analysis process for granted or at-\\ntempt to speed through it. Most observers would agree \\nthat many of the errors in developed systems are directly \\ntraceable to inadequate efforts in the analysis and design \\nphases of the life cycle. Because analysis is a large and \\ninvolved process, we divide it into two main activities to \\nmake the overall process easier to understand:\\n•\\t Requirements determination. This is primarily a fact-\\nfinding activity.\\n•\\t Requirements structuring. This activity creates a thor -\\nough and clear description of current business op-\\nerations and new information processing services.\\nThe purpose of analysis is to determine what informa-\\ntion and information processing services are needed to \\nsupport selected objectives and functions of the organi-\\nzation. Gathering this information is called requirements \\ndetermination, the subject of Chapter 6. The fact-finding \\ntechniques in Chapter 6 are used to learn about the cur-\\nrent system, the organization that the replacement sys-\\ntem will support, and user requirements or expectations \\nfor the replacement system.\\nIn Chapter 6, we also discuss a major source of new \\nsystems, Business Process Reengineering (BPR). In con-\\ntrast to the incremental improvements that drive many \\nsystems development projects, BPR results in a radical \\nredesign of the processes that information systems are \\ndesigned to support. We show how BPR relates to infor-\\nmation systems analysis in Chapter 7, where we use data \\nflow diagrams to support the reengineering process. In \\nChapter 6, you will also learn about new requirements de-\\ntermination techniques sometimes used as part of Agile \\nMethodologies. These include the Planning Game (from \\neXtreme Programming) and Usage-Centered Design.\\nInformation about current operations and require-\\nments for a replacement system must be organized for \\nanalysis and design. Organizing, or structuring, sys-\\ntem requirements results in diagrams and descriptions \\n(models) that can be analyzed to show deficiencies, inef-\\nficiencies, missing elements, and illogical components of \\nthe current business operation and information systems. \\nAlong with user requirements, they are used to deter-\\nmine the strategy for the replacement system.\\nThe results of the requirements determination can \\nbe structured according to three essential views of the \\ncurrent and replacement information systems:\\n•\\t Process. The sequence of data movement and han-\\ndling operations within the system.\\n•\\t Logic and timing. The rules by which data are trans-\\nformed and manipulated and an indication of what \\ntriggers data transformation.\\n•\\t Data. The inherent structure of data independent of \\nhow or when they are processed.\\nThe process view of a system can be represented by data \\nflow diagrams, the primary subject of Chapter 7. The \\nchapter also includes a section on decision tables—one \\nof the ways to describe the logic and timing of what goes \\non inside the process boxes in data flow diagrams. Chap-\\nter 7 ends with four appendices. The first three are each \\ndedicated to one of three techniques from the object-ori-\\nented view of development. The first appendix introduc-\\nes you to use case modeling, an object-oriented method \\nused to map a system’s functionality. The second appen-\\ndix introduces you to activity diagrams, while the third \\nfeatures sequence diagrams. These object-oriented mod-\\nels focus on system logic and timing. The fourth appen-\\ndix covers business process modeling, which is not part \\nof the object-oriented approach. Finally, the data view of \\na system, discussed in Chapter 8, shows the rules that gov-\\nern the structure and integrity of data and concentrates \\non what data about business entities and relationships \\namong these entities must be accessed within the system. \\nChapter 8 features entity relationship techniques in the \\nbody of the chapter and class diagramming techniques \\nfor modeling data in a special object-oriented section at \\nthe end of the chapter. Petrie’s case installments follow \\nChapters 7 and 8 to illustrate the processes, logic, and \\ndata models that describe a new system. The cases also il-\\nlustrate how diagrams and models for each of these three \\nviews of a system relate to one another to form a consist-\\nent and thorough structured description of a proposed \\nsystem.\\nPart three \\nAnalysis'),\n",

Analysis has two subphases: re-\\nquirements determination and requirements structuring. \\nIn this chapter, you will learn about determining system \\nrequirements. Techniques used in requirements determi-\\nnation have evolved over time to become more structured \\nand increasingly rely on computer support. We will first \\nstudy the more traditional requirements determination \\nmethods, including interviewing, observing users in their \\nwork environment, and collecting procedures and other \\nwritten documents. We will then discuss more current \\nmethods for collecting system requirements. The first of \\nthese methods is Joint Application Design (JAD). Next, \\nyou will read about how analysts rely more and more on \\ninformation systems to help them perform analysis. As \\nyou will see, CASE tools, discussed in Chapter 1, are use-\\nful in requirements determination, and prototyping has \\nbecome a key tool for some requirements determination \\nefforts. Finally, you will learn how requirements analysis \\ncontinues to be an important part of systems analysis and \\ndesign, whether the approach involves business process \\nredesign, new Agile techniques (such as constant user \\ninvolvement or usage-centered design), or focuses on de-\\nveloping Internet applications.\\nPerforming requirements \\nDeterminAtion\\nAs stated earlier and shown in Figure 6-1, there are two \\nsubphases to systems analysis: requirements determina-\\ntion and requirements structuring. We will address these \\nas separate steps, but you should consider the steps as par-\\nallel and iterative. For example, as you determine some \\naspects of the current and desired system(s), you begin to \\nstructure these requirements or build prototypes to show \\nusers how a system might behave. Inconsistencies and \\ndeficiencies discovered through structuring and proto-\\ntyping lead you to explore further the operation of cur-\\nrent system(s) and the future needs of the organization. \\nEventually, your ideas and discoveries converge in a thor-\\nough and accurate depiction of current operations and \\nrequirements for the new system. As you think about be-\\nginning the analysis phase, you are probably wondering \\nwhat exactly is involved in requirements determination. \\nWe discuss this process in the next section.\\n6.4 participate in and help plan a Joint Application \\nDesign session,\\n6.5 use prototyping during requirements \\ndetermination,\\n6.6 describe contemporary approaches to \\nrequirements determination, and\\n6.7 understand how requirements determination \\ntechniques apply to the development of electronic \\ncommerce applications.\\nLearning Objectives\\nAfter studying this chapter, you should be able to\\n6.1 describe options for designing and conducting \\ninterviews and develop a plan for conducting an \\ninterview to determine system requirements,\\n6.2 explain the advantages and pitfalls of observing \\nworkers and analyzing business documents to \\ndetermine system requirements,\\n6.3 explain how computing can provide support for \\nrequirements determination,\\nDetermining system \\nrequirements6\\nChapter\\nIntroduction'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\ASUS\\\\Desktop\\\\AI powered chatbot\\\\Data\\\\SAD.pdf', 'page': 172}, page_content='148 Part III   AnAlysis\\nthe Process of Determining requirements\\nOnce management has granted permission to pursue development of a new system \\n(this was done at the end of the project identification and selection phase of the \\nSDLC) and a project is initiated and planned (see Chapter 5), you begin determining \\nwhat the new system should do. During requirements determination, you and other \\nanalysts gather information on what the system should do from as many sources as \\npossible: from users of the current system; from observing users; and from reports, \\nforms, and procedures. All of the system requirements are carefully documented and \\nprepared for structuring, the subject of Chapters 7 and 8.\\nIn many ways, gathering system requirements is like conducting any investiga-\\ntion. Have you read any of the Sherlock Holmes or similar mystery stories? Do you \\nenjoy solving puzzles? From these experiences, we can detect some similar character-\\nistics for a good systems analyst during the requirements determination subphase. \\nThese characteristics include the following:\\n•\\t Impertinence. You should question everything. You need to ask questions such \\nas: Are all transactions processed the same way? Could anyone be charged \\nsomething other than the standard price? Might we someday want to allow and \\nencourage employees to work for more than one department?\\n•\\t Impartiality. Your role is to find the best solution to a business problem or \\nopportunity. It is not, for example, to find a way to justify the purchase of new \\nhardware or to insist on incorporating what users think they want into the new \\nsystem requirements. You must consider issues raised by all parties and try to \\nfind the best organizational solution.\\n•\\t Relax constraints. Assume that anything is possible and eliminate the infeasible. \\nFor example, do not accept this statement: “We’ve always done it that way, \\nso we have to continue the practice.” Traditions are different from rules and \\npolicies. Traditions probably started for a good reason but, as the organization \\nand its environment change, they may turn into habits rather than sensible \\nprocedures.\\n•\\t Attention to details. Every fact must fit with every other fact. One element out of \\nplace means that even the best system will fail at some time. For example, an \\nimprecise definition of who a customer is may mean that you purge customer \\ndata when a customer has no active orders, yet these past customers may be vital \\ncontacts for future sales.\\nDesignImplementation\\nPlanning\\nMaintenance Requirements Determination\\nRequirements Structuring\\nAnalysis\\nFigure 6-1 \\nSystems development life cycle with analysis phase highlighted.'),\n",

Analysis is, in part, a creative process. You must challenge yourself \\nto look at the organization in new ways. You must consider how each user views \\nhis or her requirements. You must be careful not to jump to the following \\nconclusion: “I worked on a system like that once—this new system must work \\nthe same way as the one I built before.”\\nDeliverables and outcomes\\nThe primary deliverables from requirements determination are the various forms of \\ninformation gathered during the determination process: transcripts of interviews; \\nnotes from observation and analysis of documents; sets of forms, reports, job descrip-\\ntions, and other documents; and computer-generated output such as system proto-\\ntypes. In short, anything that the analysis team collects as part of determining system \\nrequirements is included in the deliverables resulting from this subphase of the sys-\\ntems development life cycle. Table 6-1 lists examples of some specific information \\nthat might be gathered during requirements determination.\\nThese deliverables contain the information you need for systems analysis within \\nthe scope of the system you are developing. In addition, you need to understand the \\nfollowing components of an organization:\\n•\\t The business objectives that drive what and how work is done\\n•\\t The information people need to do their jobs\\n•\\t The data (definition, volume, size, etc.) handled within the organization to \\nsupport the jobs\\n•\\t When, how, and by whom or what the data are moved, transformed, and stored\\n•\\t The sequence and other dependencies among different data-handling activities\\n•\\t The rules governing how data are handled and processed\\n•\\t Policies and guidelines that describe the nature of the business and the market \\nand environment in which it operates\\n•\\t Key events affecting data values and when these events occur\\nAs should be obvious, such a large amount of information must be organized in order \\nto be useful. This is the purpose of the next subphase—requirements structuring.\\nFrom just this subphase of analysis, you have probably already realized that \\nthe amount of information to be gathered could be huge, especially if the scope \\nof the system under development is broad. The time required to collect and struc-\\nture a great deal of information can be extensive and, because it involves so much \\nhuman effort, quite expensive. Too much analysis is not productive, and the term \\nanalysis paralysis has been coined to describe a systems development project that has \\nbecome bogged down in an abundance of analysis work. Because of the dangers of \\nexcessive analysis, today’s systems analysts focus more on the system to be developed \\nthan on the current system. The techniques you will learn about later in this chapter, \\nJAD and prototyping, were developed to keep the analysis effort at a minimum yet \\nstill keep it effective. Newer techniques have also been developed to keep require-\\nments  determination fast and flexible, including continual user involvement, usage-\\ncentered design, and the Planning Game from eXtreme Programming. Traditional \\n fact-gathering techniques are the subject of the next section.\\nTable 6-1  Deliverables for Requirements Determination\\n1.

At the outset, you \\nmust collect information about the information systems that are currently being used \\nand how users would like to improve the current systems and organizational opera-\\ntions with new or replacement information systems. One of the best ways to get this \\ninformation is to talk to the people who are directly or indirectly involved in the \\ndifferent parts of the organizations affected by the possible system changes: users, \\nmanagers, funders, and so on. Another way to find out about the current system \\nis to gather copies of documentation relevant to current systems and business pro-\\ncesses. In this chapter, you will learn about various ways to get information directly \\nfrom stakeholders: interviews, group interviews, the Nominal Group Technique, and \\ndirect observation. You will learn about collecting documentation on the current sys-\\ntem and organizational operation in the form of written procedures, forms, reports, \\nand other hard copy. These traditional methods of collecting system requirements \\nare listed in Table 6-2.\\ninterviewing and listening\\nInterviewing is one of the primary ways analysts gather information about an infor -\\nmation systems project. Early in a project, an analyst may spend a large amount of \\ntime interviewing people about their work, the information they use to do it, and the \\ntypes of information processing that might supplement their work. Other stakehold-\\ners are interviewed to understand organizational direction, policies, expectations \\nmanagers have on the units they supervise, and other nonroutine aspects of organi-\\nzational operations. During interviewing you will gather facts, opinions, and specula-\\ntion and observe body language, emotions, and other signs of what people want and \\nhow they assess current systems.\\nThere are many ways to effectively interview someone, and no one method is \\nnecessarily better than another. Some guidelines you should keep in mind when you \\ninterview, summarized in Table 6-3, are discussed next.\\nFirst, you should prepare thoroughly before the interview. Set up an appoint-\\nment at a time and for a duration convenient for the interviewee. The general nature \\nof the interview should be explained to the interviewee in advance. You may ask the \\ninterviewee to think about specific questions or issues or to review certain documen-\\ntation to prepare for the interview. You should spend some time thinking about what \\nyou need to find out and write down your questions. Do not assume that you can \\nanticipate all possible questions. You want the interview to be natural, and, to some \\ndegree, you want to spontaneously direct the interview as you discover what expertise \\nthe interviewee brings to the session.\\nYou should prepare an interview guide or checklist so that you know in which \\nsequence you intend to ask your questions and how much time you want to spend \\nin each area of the interview. The checklist might include some probing questions \\nTable 6-2  Traditional Methods of Collecting System Requirements\\n•\\tIndividually interview people informed about the operation and issues of the current system \\nand future systems needs\\n•\\tInterview groups of people with diverse needs to find synergies and contrasts among system \\nrequirements\\n•\\tObserve workers at selected times to see how data are handled and what information people \\nneed to do their jobs\\n•\\tStudy business documents to discover reported issues, policies, rules, and directions as well \\nas concrete examples of the use of data and information in the organization\\nTable 6-3   Guidelines for effective \\nInterviewing\\nPlan the Interview\\n•\\tPrepare interviewee: appoint-\\nment, priming questions\\n•\\tPrepare checklist, agenda, and \\nquestions\\nListen carefully and take notes \\n(record if permitted)\\nReview notes within 48 hours of \\ninterview\\nBe neutral\\nSeek diverse views'),\n",

You can, to some de-\\ngree, integrate your interview guide with the notes you take during the interview, as \\ndepicted in a sample guide in Figure 6-2. This same guide can serve as an outline for \\na summary of what you discover during an interview.\\nThe first page of the sample interview guide contains a general outline of the \\ninterview. Besides basic information on who is being interviewed and when, you list \\nmajor objectives for the interview. These objectives typically cover the most impor-\\ntant data you need to collect, a list of issues on which you need to seek agreement \\n(e.g., content for certain system reports), and which areas you need to explore, not \\nnecessarily with specific questions. You also include reminder notes to yourself on \\nkey information about the interviewee (e.g., job history, known positions taken on is-\\nsues, and role with current system). This information helps you to be personal, shows \\nthat you consider the interviewee to be important, and may assist you in interpreting \\nsome answers. Also included is an agenda for the interview with approximate time \\nlimits for different sections of the interview. You may not follow the time limits pre-\\ncisely, but the schedule helps you cover all areas during the time the interviewee is \\navailable. Space is also allotted for general observations that do not fit under specific \\nquestions and for notes taken during the interview about topics skipped or issues \\nraised that could not be resolved.\\nOn subsequent pages you list specific questions; the sample form in Figure 6-2 \\nincludes space for taking notes on these questions. Because unanticipated informa-\\ntion arises, you will not strictly follow the guide in sequence. You can, however, check \\noff the questions you have asked and write reminders to yourself to return to or skip \\ncertain questions as the dynamics of the interview unfold.\\nChoosing Interview Questions You need to decide what mix and sequence of open-\\nended and closed-ended questions you will use. Open-ended questions are usually \\nused to probe for information for which you cannot anticipate all possible responses \\nor for which you do not know the precise question to ask. The person being inter-\\nviewed is encouraged to talk about whatever interests him or her within the general \\nbounds of the question. An example is, “What would you say is the best thing about \\nthe information system you currently use to do your job?” or “List the three most \\nfrequently used menu options.” You must react quickly to answers and determine \\nwhether or not any follow-up questions are needed for clarification or elaboration. \\nSometimes body language will suggest that a user has given an incomplete answer or \\nis reluctant to divulge some information; a follow-up question might yield additional \\ninsight. One advantage of open-ended questions is that previously unknown informa-\\ntion can surface. You can then continue exploring along unexpected lines of inquiry \\nto reveal even more new information. Open-ended questions also often put the inter-\\nviewees at ease because they are able to respond in their own words using their own \\nstructure; open-ended questions give interviewees more of a sense of involvement \\nand control in the interview. A major disadvantage of open-ended questions is the \\nlength of time it can take for the questions to be answered. In addition, open-ended \\nquestions can be difficult to summarize.\\nClosed-ended questions provide a range of answers from which the interviewee \\nmay choose. Here is an example:\\nWhich of the following would you say is the one best thing about the information system \\nyou currently use to do your job (pick only one)?\\na. Having easy access to all of the data you need\\nb. The system’s response time\\nc. The ability to access the system from remote locations\\nClosed-ended questions work well when the major answers to questions are well \\nknown. Another plus is that interviews based on closed-ended questions do not nec-\\nessarily require a large time commitment—more topics can be covered. You can see \\nbody language and hear voice tone, which can aid in interpreting the interviewee’s \\nOpen-ended questions\\nQuestions in interviews that have no \\nprespecified answers.\\nClosed-ended questions\\nQuestions in interviews that ask those \\nresponding to choose from among a set of \\nspecified responses.'),\n",

Closed-ended questions can also be an easy way to begin an interview \\nand to determine which line of open-ended questions to pursue. You can include \\nan “other” option to encourage the interviewee to add unanticipated responses. A \\nmajor disadvantage of closed-ended questions is that useful information that does \\nnot quite fit into the defined answers may be overlooked as the respondent tries to \\nmake a choice instead of providing his or her best answer.\\nClosed-ended questions, like objective questions on an examination, can follow \\nseveral forms, including the following choices:\\n•\\t True or false.\\n•\\t Multiple choice (with only one response or selecting all relevant choices).\\n•\\t Rating a response or idea on a scale, say from bad to good or strongly agree to \\nstrongly disagree. Each point on the scale should have a clear and consistent \\nmeaning to each person, and there is usually a neutral point in the middle of \\nthe scale.\\n•\\t Ranking items in order of importance.\\nInterview Guidelines  First, with either open- or closed-ended questions, do not \\nphrase a question in a way that implies a right or wrong answer. The respondent must \\nfeel that he or she can state his or her true opinion and perspective and that his or \\nher idea will be considered equally with those of others. Questions such as “Should \\nthe system continue to provide the ability to override the default value, even though \\nmost users now do not like the feature?” should be avoided because such wording \\npredefines a socially acceptable answer.\\nThe second guideline to remember about interviews is to listen very carefully to \\nwhat is being said. Take careful notes or, if possible, record the interview (be sure to \\nask permission first!). The answers may contain extremely important information for \\nthe project. Also, this may be the only chance you have to get information from this \\nparticular person. If you run out of time and still need to get information from the \\nperson you are talking to, ask to schedule a follow-up interview.\\nThird, once the interview is over, go back to your office and type up your notes \\nwithin 48 hours. If you recorded the interview, use the recording to verify the material \\nin your notes. After 48 hours, your memory of the interview will fade quickly. As you \\ntype and organize your notes, write down any additional questions that might arise \\nfrom lapses in your notes or from ambiguous information. Separate facts from your \\nopinions and interpretations. Make a list of unclear points that need clarification. Call \\nthe person you interviewed and get answers to these new questions. Use the phone \\ncall as an opportunity to verify the accuracy of your notes. You may also want to send a \\nwritten copy of your notes to the person you interviewed so the person can check your \\nnotes for accuracy. Finally, make sure you thank the person for his or her time. You may \\nneed to talk to your respondent again. If the interviewee will be a user of your system or \\nis involved in another way in the system’s success, you want to leave a good impression.\\nFourth, be careful during the interview not to set expectations about the new \\nor replacement system unless you are sure these features will be part of the delivered \\nsystem. Let the interviewee know that there are many steps to the project and the \\nperspectives of many people need to be considered, along with what is technically \\npossible. Let respondents know that their ideas will be carefully considered, but that \\ndue to the iterative nature of the systems development process, it is premature to say \\nnow exactly what the ultimate system will or will not do.\\nFifth, seek a variety of perspectives from the interviews. Find out what potential \\nusers of the system, users of other systems that might be affected by changes, manag-\\ners and superiors, information systems staff who have experience with the current \\nsystem, and others think the current problems and opportunities are and what new \\ninformation services might better serve the organization. You want to understand \\nall possible perspectives so that in a later approval step you will have information on \\nwhich to base a recommendation or design decision that all stakeholders can accept.'),\n",

A series \\nof interviews may turn up inconsistent information about the current system or its \\nreplacement. You must work through all of these inconsistencies to figure out what \\nmight be the most accurate representation of current and future systems. Such a \\nprocess requires several follow-up phone calls and additional interviews. Catching \\nimportant people in their offices is often difficult and frustrating, and scheduling \\nnew interviews may become very time consuming. In addition, new interviews may \\nreveal new questions that in turn require additional interviews with those interviewed \\nearlier. Clearly, gathering information about an information system through a series \\nof individual interviews and follow-up calls is not an efficient process.\\nAnother option available to you is the group interview. In a group interview, \\nseveral key people are interviewed at once. To make sure all of the important infor -\\nmation is collected, you may conduct the interview with one or more analysts. In \\nthe case of multiple interviewers, one analyst may ask questions while another takes \\nnotes, or different analysts might concentrate on different kinds of information. For \\nexample, one analyst may listen for data requirements while another notes the timing \\nand triggering of key events. The number of interviewees involved in the process may \\nrange from two to however many you believe can be comfortably accommodated.\\nA group interview has a few advantages. One, it is a much more effective use of \\nyour time than a series of interviews with individuals (although the time commitment \\nof the interviewees may be more of a concern). Two, interviewing several people \\ntogether allows them to hear the opinions of other key people and gives them the \\nopportunity to agree or disagree with their peers. Synergies also often occur. For \\nexample, the comments of one person might cause another person to say, “That \\nreminds me of” or “I didn’t know that was a problem.” You can benefit from such \\na discussion as it helps you identify issues on which there is general agreement and \\nareas where views diverge widely.\\nThe primary disadvantage of a group interview is the difficulty in scheduling \\nit. The more people who are involved, the more difficult it will be finding a conve-\\nnient time and place for everyone. Modern videoconferencing technology can mini-\\nmize the geographical dispersion factors that make scheduling meetings so difficult. \\nGroup interviews are at the core of the JAD process, which we discuss in a later sec-\\ntion in this chapter. A specific technique for working with groups, Nominal Group \\nTechnique, is discussed next.\\nNominal Group Technique Many different techniques have been developed over \\nthe years to improve the process of working with groups. One of the more popular \\ntechniques for generating ideas among group members is called Nominal Group \\nTechnique (NGT). NGT is exactly what the name indicates—the individuals working \\ntogether to solve a problem are a group in name only, or nominally. Group members \\nmay be gathered in the same room for NGT, but they all work alone for a period of \\ntime. Typically, group members make a written list of their ideas. At the end of the \\nidea-generation time, group members pool their individual ideas under the guid-\\nance of a trained facilitator. Pooling usually involves having the facilitator ask each \\nperson in turn for an idea that has not been presented before. As the person reads \\nthe idea aloud, someone else writes down the idea on a blackboard or flip chart. \\nAfter all of the ideas have been introduced, the facilitator will then ask for the group \\nto openly discuss each idea, primarily for clarification.\\nOnce all of the ideas are understood by all of the participants, the facilitator \\nwill try to reduce the number of ideas the group will carry forward for additional \\nconsideration. There are many ways to reduce the number of ideas. The facilitator \\nmay ask participants to choose only a subset of ideas that they believe are important. \\nThen the facilitator will go around the room, asking each person to read aloud an \\nNominal group Technique \\n(NgT)\\nA facilitated process that supports idea \\ngeneration by groups. At the beginning of \\nthe process, group members work alone to \\ngenerate ideas. The ideas are then pooled \\nunder the guidance of a trained facilitator.'),\n",

At some point, the facilitator and the group \\nend up with a tractable set of ideas, which can be further prioritized.\\nIn a requirements determination context, the ideas being sought in an NGT \\nexercise would typically apply to problems with the existing system or ideas for new \\nfeatures in the system being developed. The end result would be a list of either prob-\\nlems or features that group members themselves had generated and prioritized. \\nThere should be a high level of ownership of such a list, at least for the group that \\ntook part in the NGT exercise.\\nThere is some evidence to support the use of NGT to help focus and refine the \\nwork of a group in that the number and quality of ideas that result from an NGT may \\nbe higher than what would normally be obtained from an unfacilitated group meet-\\ning. An NGT exercise could be used to complement the work done in a typical group \\ninterview or as part of a Joint Application Design effort, described in more detail \\nlater in this chapter.\\nDirectly observing users\\nAll the methods of collecting information that we have been discussing up until now \\ninvolve getting people to recall and convey information they have about an organi-\\nzational area and the information systems that support these processes. People, how-\\never, are not always very reliable informants, even when they try to be reliable and \\ntell what they think is the truth. As odd as it may sound, people often do not have a \\ncompletely accurate appreciation of what they do or how they do it. This is especially \\ntrue concerning infrequent events, issues from the past, or issues for which people \\nhave considerable passion. Because people cannot always be trusted to reliably inter-\\npret and report their own actions, you can supplement and corroborate what people \\ntell you by watching what they do or by obtaining relatively objective measures of \\nhow people behave in work situations. (See the box “Lost Soft Drink Sales” for an \\nexample of the importance of systems analysts learning firsthand about the business \\nfor which they are designing systems.)\\nFor example, one possible view of how a hypothetical manager does her job \\nis that a manager carefully plans her activities, works for long periods of time and \\nconsistently on solving problems, and controls the pace of her work. A manager \\nmight tell you that is how she spends her day. When Mintzberg (1973) observed how \\nmanagers work, however, he found that a manager’s day is actually punctuated by \\nmany, many interruptions. Managers work in a fragmented manner, focusing on a \\nproblem or on a communication for only a short time before they are interrupted \\nby phone calls or visits from their subordinates and other managers. An information \\nsystem designed to fit the work environment described by our hypothetical manager \\nwould not effectively support the actual work environment in which that manager \\nfinds herself.\\nAs another example, consider the difference between what another employee \\nmight tell you about how much he uses e-mail and how much e-mail use you might \\ndiscover through more objective means. An employee might tell you he is swamped \\nwith e-mail messages and that he spends a significant proportion of his time respond-\\ning to e-mail. However, if you were able to check electronic mail records, you might \\nfind that this employee receives only 3 e-mail messages per day on average, and that \\nthe most messages he has ever received during one eight-hour period is 10. In this \\ncase, you were able to obtain an accurate behavioral measure of how much e-mail \\nthis employee copes with without having to watch him read his e-mail.\\nThe intent behind obtaining system records and direct observation is the same, \\nhowever, and that is to obtain more firsthand and objective measures of employee \\ninteraction with information systems. In some cases, behavioral measures will be \\na more accurate reflection of reality than what employees believe. In other cases, '),\n",

Thus, these methods are not totally unbiased, just as no other one data-\\ngathering method is unbiased.\\nFor example, observation can cause people to change their normal operating \\nbehavior. Employees who know they are being observed may be nervous and make \\nmore mistakes than normal, may be careful to follow exact procedures they do not \\ntypically follow, and may work faster or slower than normal. Moreover, because ob-\\nservation typically cannot be continuous, you receive only a snapshot image of the \\nperson or task you observe, which may not include important events or activities. \\nBecause observation is very time consuming, you will not only observe for a limited \\ntime, but also a limited number of people and a limited number of sites. Again, obser-\\nvation yields only a small segment of data from a possibly vast variety of data sources. \\nExactly which people or sites to observe is a difficult selection problem. You want \\nto pick both typical and atypical people and sites, and observe during normal and \\nabnormal conditions and times to receive the richest possible data from observation.\\nAnalyzing Procedures and other Documents\\nAs noted earlier, asking questions of the people who use a system every day or who \\nhave an interest in a system is an effective way to gather information about current \\nand future systems. Observing current system users is a more direct way of seeing how \\nan existing system operates, but even this method provides limited exposure to all as-\\npects of current operations. These methods of determining system requirements can \\nbe enhanced by examining system and organizational documentation to discover \\nmore details about current systems and the organization these systems support.\\nAlthough we discuss here several important types of documents that are useful in \\nunderstanding possible future system requirements, our discussion does not exhaust \\nall possibilities. You should attempt to find all written documents about the organiza-\\ntional areas relevant to the systems under redesign. Besides the few specific documents \\nA systems analyst was quite surprised to read that sales of all \\nsoft-drink products were lower, instead of higher, after a new \\ndelivery truck routing system was installed. The software was \\ndesigned to reduce stock-outs at customer sites by allowing \\ndrivers to visit each customer more often using more efficient \\ndelivery routes.\\nConfused by the results, management asked the analyst to \\ndelay a scheduled vacation, but he insisted that he could look \\nafresh at the system only after a few overdue days of rest and \\nrelaxation.\\nInstead of taking a vacation, however, the analyst called \\na delivery dispatcher he interviewed during the design of the \\nsystem and asked to be given a route for a few days. The \\nanalyst drove a route (for a regular driver who was actually on \\nvacation), following the schedule developed from the new sys-\\ntem. What the analyst discovered was that the route was very \\nefficient, as expected; so at first the analyst could not see any \\nreason for lost sales.\\nDuring the third and last day of his “vacation,” the analyst \\nstayed overtime at one store to ask the manager if she had \\nany ideas why sales might have dropped off in recent weeks. \\nThe manager had no explanation but did make a seemingly \\nunrelated observation that the regular route driver appeared \\nto have less time to spend in the store. He did not seem to take \\nas much interest in where the products were displayed and did \\nnot ask for promotional signs to be displayed, as he had often \\ndone in the past.\\nFrom this conversation, the analyst concluded that the new \\ndelivery truck routing system was, in one sense, too good. \\nIt placed the driver on such a tight schedule that he had no \\ntime left for the “schmoozing” required to get special treat-\\nment, which gave the company’s products an edge over the \\ncompetition.\\nWithout firsthand observation of the system in action \\ngained by participating as a system user, the analyst might \\nnever have discovered the true problem with the system \\ndesign. Once time was allotted for not only stocking new \\nproducts but also for necessary marketing work, product sales \\nreturned to and exceeded levels achieved before the new sys-\\ntem had been introduced.\\nlost Soft Drink Sales'),\n",

In documents you can find information about the following:\\n•\\t Problems with existing systems (e.g., missing information or redundant steps)\\n•\\t Opportunities to meet new needs if only certain information or information \\nprocessing were available (e.g., analysis of sales based on customer type)\\n•\\t Organizational direction that can influence information system requirements \\n(e.g., trying to link customers and suppliers more closely to the organization)\\n•\\t Titles and names of key individuals who have an interest in relevant existing \\nsystems (e.g., the name of a sales manager who led a study of the buying \\nbehavior of key customers)\\n•\\t Values of the organization or individuals who can help determine priorities for \\ndifferent capabilities desired by different users (e.g., maintaining market share \\neven if it means lower short-term profits)\\n•\\t Special information processing circumstances that occur irregularly that may \\nnot be identified by any other requirements determination technique (e.g., \\nspecial handling needed for a few large-volume customers that requires use of \\ncustomized customer ordering procedures)\\n•\\t The reason why current systems are designed as they are, which can suggest \\nfeatures left out of current software, which may now be feasible and more \\ndesirable (e.g., data about a customer’s purchase of competitors’ products were \\nnot available when the current system was designed; these data are now available \\nfrom several sources)\\n•\\t Data, rules for processing data, and principles by which the organization \\noperates that must be enforced by the information system (e.g., each customer \\nis assigned exactly one sales department staff member as a primary contact if the \\ncustomer has any questions)\\nOne type of useful document is a written work procedure for an individual or \\na work group. The procedure describes how a particular job or task is performed, \\nincluding data and information that are used and created in the process of perform-\\ning the job. For example, the procedure shown in Figure 6-3 includes the data (list \\nof features and advantages, drawings, inventor name, and witness names) that are \\nrequired to prepare an invention disclosure. It also indicates that besides the inven-\\ntor, the vice president for research, the department head, and the dean must review \\nthe material, and that a witness is required for any filing of an invention disclosure. \\nThese insights clearly affect what data must be kept, to whom information must be \\nsent, and the rules that govern valid forms.\\nProcedures are not trouble-free sources of information, however. Sometimes \\nyour analysis of several written procedures will reveal a duplication of effort in two \\nor more jobs. You should call such duplication to the attention of management as an \\nissue to be resolved before system design can proceed. That is, it may be necessary to \\nredesign the organization before the redesign of an information system can achieve \\nits full benefits. Another problem you may encounter with a procedure occurs when \\nthe procedure is missing. Again, it is not your job to create a document for a missing \\nprocedure—that is up to management. A third and common problem with a written \\nprocedure happens when the procedure is out of date. You may realize the procedure \\nis out of date when you interview the person responsible for performing the task de-\\nscribed in the procedure. Once again, the decision to rewrite the procedure so that it \\nmatches reality is made by management, but you may make suggestions based upon \\nyour understanding of the organization. A fourth problem often encountered with \\nwritten procedures is that the formal procedures may contradict information you col-\\nlected from interviews and observation about how the organization operates and what \\ninformation is required. As in the other cases, resolution rests with management.'),\n",

Formal systems are recognized in the official documentation of \\nthe organization; informal systems are the way in which the organization actually \\nworks. Informal systems develop because of inadequacies of formal procedures, in-\\ndividual work habits and preferences, resistance to control, and other factors. It is \\nimportant to understand both formal and informal systems because each provides \\ninsight into information requirements and what will be required to convert from \\npresent to future information services.\\nA second type of document useful to systems analysts is a business form (see \\nFigure 6-4). Forms are used for all types of business functions, from recording an order \\nacknowledging the payment of a bill to indicating what goods have been shipped. \\nForms are important for understanding a system because they explicitly indicate what \\nFormal system\\nThe official way a system works as \\ndescribed in organizational documentation.\\ninformal system\\nThe way a system actually works.\\nGUIDE FOR PREPARATION OF INVENTION DISCLOSUR E\\n(See FACULTY and STAFF MANUALS for Detailed\\nPatent Policy and Routing Procedures.)\\n(1) DISCLOSE ONLY ONE INVENTION PER FORM.\\n(2)P REPARE COMPLETE DISCLOSURE.\\nThe disclosure of your invention is adequate for patent purposes ONLY if it enables a\\nperson skilled in the art to understand the invention.\\n(3) CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING IN PREPARING A COMPLETE DISCLOSURE:\\n(a) All essential elements of the invention, their relationship to one another, and their\\nmode of operation.\\n(b) Equivalents that can be substituted for any elements.\\n(c) List of features believed to be new .\\n(d) Advantages this invention has over the prior art.\\n(e) Whether the invention has been built and/or tested.\\n(4) PROVIDE APPROPRIATE ADDITIONAL MATERIAL.\\nDrawings and descriptive material should be provided as needed to clarify the dis-\\nclosure.

For \\nexample, the company can ship and bill to different addresses; customers can have \\ndiscounts applied; and the freight expense is charged to the customer. A printed form \\nmay correspond to a computer display that the system will generate for someone to \\nenter and maintain data or to display data to online users. Forms are most useful to \\nyou when they contain actual organizational data because this allows you to determine \\nthe characteristics of the data that are actually used by the application. The ways in \\nwhich people use forms change over time, and data that were needed when a form was \\ndesigned may no longer be required. You can use the systems analysis techniques pre-\\nsented in Chapters 7 and 8 to help you determine which data are no longer required.\\nA third type of useful document is a report generated by current systems. As \\nthe primary output for some types of systems, a report enables you to work backward \\nfrom the information on the report to the data that must have been necessary to gen-\\nerate them.

For exam-\\nple, it is quite popular in the insurance industry in Connecticut, where a JAD users’ \\ngroup has been formed. In fact, several generic approaches to JAD have been docu-\\nmented and popularized (see Wood and Silver, 1995, for an example). The main \\nidea behind JAD is to bring together the key users, managers, and systems analysts \\ninvolved in the analysis of a current system. In that respect, JAD is similar to a group \\ninterview; a JAD, however, follows a particular structure of roles and agenda that is \\nquite different from a group interview during which analysts control the sequence of \\nquestions answered by users. The primary purpose of using JAD in the analysis phase \\nis to collect systems requirements simultaneously from the key people involved with \\nthe system. The result is an intense and structured, but highly effective, process. As \\nwith a group interview, having all the key people together in one place at one time al-\\nlows analysts to see where there are areas of agreement and where there are conflicts. \\nMeeting with all of these important people for over a week of intense sessions allows \\nyou the opportunity to resolve conflicts, or at least to understand why a conflict may \\nnot be simple to resolve.\\nJAD sessions are usually conducted at a location other than the place where \\nthe people involved normally work. The idea behind such a practice is to keep par -\\nticipants away from as many distractions as possible so that they can concentrate on \\nsystems analysis. A JAD may last anywhere from four hours to an entire week and \\nmay consist of several sessions. A JAD employs thousands of dollars of corporate re-\\nsources, the most expensive of which is the time of the people involved. Other ex-\\npenses include the costs associated with flying people to a remote site and putting \\nthem up in hotels and feeding them for several days.\\nThe typical participants in a JAD are listed below:\\n•\\t JAD session leader. The JAD session leader organizes and runs the JAD. This \\nperson has been trained in group management and facilitation as well as in \\nsystems analysis. The JAD leader sets the agenda and sees that it is met; he or \\nshe remains neutral on issues and does not contribute ideas or opinions, but \\nrather concentrates on keeping the group on the agenda, resolving conflicts \\nand disagreements, and soliciting all ideas.\\n•\\t Users. The key users of the system under consideration are vital participants in a \\nJAD. They are the only ones who have a clear understanding of what it means to \\nuse the system on a daily basis.\\n•\\t Managers. Managers of the work groups who use the system in question \\nprovide insight into new organizational directions, motivations for and \\norganizational impacts of systems, and support for requirements determined \\nduring the JAD.\\n•\\t Sponsor. As a major undertaking due to its expense, a JAD must be sponsored \\nby someone at a relatively high level in the company. If the sponsor attends any \\nsessions, it is usually only at the very beginning or the end.\\n•\\t Systems analysts. Members of the systems analysis team attend the JAD, although \\ntheir actual participation may be limited. Analysts are there to learn from users \\nand managers, not to run or dominate the process.\\n•\\t Scribe. The scribe takes notes during the JAD sessions. This is usually done on a \\nlaptop. Notes may be taken using a word processor, or notes and diagrams may \\nbe entered directly into a CASE tool.\\n•\\t IS staff. Besides systems analysts, other information systems (IS) staff, such \\nas programmers, database analysts, IS planners, and data center personnel, \\nmay attend to learn from the discussion and possibly contribute their ideas \\non the technical feasibility of proposed ideas or the technical limitations of \\ncurrent systems.\\nJoint Application Design \\n(JAD)\\nA structured process in which users, \\nmanagers, and analysts work together \\nfor several days in a series of intensive \\nmeetings to specify or review system \\nrequirements.\\nJAD session leader\\nThe trained individual who plans and leads \\nJoint Application Design sessions.\\nScribe\\nThe person who makes detailed notes \\nof the happenings at a Joint Application \\nDesign session.'),\n",

These rooms are typically equipped \\nwith whiteboards. Other audiovisual tools may be used, such as magnetic symbols that \\ncan be easily rearranged on a whiteboard, flip charts, and computer-generated displays. \\nFlip-chart paper is typically used for keeping track of issues that cannot be resolved dur-\\ning the JAD or for those issues requiring additional information that can be gathered \\nduring breaks in the proceedings.

Because \\nthese questions cannot be answered during this meeting (none of the original de-\\nsigners are present and none of the original design documents are readily available), \\nthe session leader assigns the question about intent to the “to do” list. This question \\nbecomes the first one on a flip-chart sheet of “to do” items, and the session leader \\ngives you the assignment of finding out about the intent of the original designers. \\nShe writes your name next to the “to do” item on the list and continues with the ses-\\nsion. Before the end of the JAD, you must get an answer to this question.\\nThe JAD will continue like this for its duration. Analysts will make presenta-\\ntions, help lead discussions on form and report design, answer questions from users \\nand managers, and take notes on what is being said. After each meeting, the analy-\\nsis team will meet, usually informally, to discuss what has occurred that day and to \\nconsolidate what they have learned. Users will continue to contribute during the \\nmeetings, and the session leader will facilitate, intervening in conflicts and seeing \\nthat the group follows the agenda. When the JAD is over, the session leader and her \\nassistants must prepare a report that documents the findings in the JAD and is circu-\\nlated among users and analysts.\\nCASE Tools During JAD For requirements determination and structuring, the most \\nuseful CASE tools are for diagramming and form and report generation. The more \\ninteraction analysts have with users during this phase, the more useful this set of \\ntools is. The analyst can use diagramming and prototyping tools to give graphic form \\nto system requirements, show the tools to users, and make changes based on the \\nusers’ reactions. The same tools are very valuable for requirements structuring as \\nwell. Using common CASE tools during requirements determination and structuring \\nmakes the transition between these two subphases easier and reduces the total time \\nspent. In structuring, CASE tools that analyze requirements information for correct-\\nness, completeness, and consistency are also useful. Finally, for alternative genera-\\ntion and selection, diagramming and prototyping tools are key to presenting users \\nwith graphic illustrations of what the alternative systems will look like. Such a practice \\nprovides users and analysts with better information to select the most desirable alter-\\nnative system.\\nSome observers advocate using CASE tools during JADs (Lucas, 1993). Running \\na CASE tool during a JAD enables analysts to enter system models directly into a \\nCASE tool, providing consistency and reliability in the joint model-building process. \\nThe CASE tool captures system requirements in a more flexible and useful way than \\ncan a scribe or an analysis team making notes. Further, the CASE tool can be used to \\nproject menu, display, and report designs, so users can directly observe old and new \\ndesigns and evaluate their usefulness for the analysis team.'),\n",

What we \\nare interested in here is how prototyping can augment the requirements determina-\\ntion process.\\nIn order to gather an initial basic set of requirements, you will still have to inter-\\nview users and collect documentation. Prototyping, however, will enable you to quickly \\nconvert basic requirements into a working, though limited, version of the desired in-\\nformation system. The prototype will then be viewed and tested by the user. Typically, \\nseeing verbal descriptions of requirements converted into a physical system will prompt \\nthe user to modify existing requirements and generate new ones. For example, in the \\ninitial interviews, a user might have said that he wanted all relevant utility billing infor-\\nmation (e.g., the client’s name and address, the service record, and payment history) \\non a single computer display form. Once the same user sees how crowded and confus-\\ning such a design would be in the prototype, he might change his mind and instead \\nask to have the information organized on several screens, but with easy transitions \\nfrom one screen to another. He might also be reminded of some important require-\\nments (data, calculations, etc.) that had not surfaced during the initial interviews.\\nYou would then redesign the prototype to incorporate the suggested changes \\n(Figure 6-7). Once modified, users would again view and test the prototype. And, \\nonce again, you would incorporate their suggestions for change. Through such an it-\\nerative process, the chances are good that you will be able to better capture a system’s \\nrequirements.\\nAs the prototype changes through each iteration, more and more of the design \\nspecifications for the system are captured in the prototype. The prototype can then \\nserve as the basis for the production system in a process called evolutionary prototyp-\\ning. Alternatively, the prototype can serve only as a model, which is then used as a \\nreference for the construction of the actual system. In this process, called throwaway \\nprototyping, the prototype is discarded after it has been used.\\nEvolutionary Prototyping  In evolutionary prototyping, you begin by modeling \\nparts of the target system and, if the prototyping process is successful, you evolve the \\nrest of the system from those parts (McConnell, 1996). A life-cycle model of evolu-\\ntionary prototyping illustrates the iterative nature of the process and the tendency to \\nrefine the prototype until it is ready to release (Figure 6-8). One key aspect of this ap-\\nproach is that the prototype becomes the actual production system. Because of this, \\nyou often start with those parts of the system that are most difficult and uncertain.\\nPrototyping\\nAn iterative process of systems development \\nin which requirements are converted to a \\nworking system that is continually revised \\nthrough close collaboration between an \\nanalyst and users.\\nIdentify\\nProblem\\nInitial\\nRequirements Develop\\nPrototype\\nProblems\\nWorking Prototype New Requirements\\nNext Version\\nConvert to\\nOperational\\nSystem\\nImplement and\\nUse Prototype\\nRevise and Enhance\\nPrototype\\nIf Prototype\\nIneﬃcient Figure 6-7 \\nThe prototyping methodology\\n(Source: Based on “Prototyping: The New \\nParadigm for Systems Development,” by \\nJ.

Any \\ngiven system must be designed to facilitate database access, database integrity, system \\nsecurity, and networking. Systems also must be designed to support scalability, mul-\\ntiuser support, and multiplatform support. Few of these design specifications will be \\ncoded into a prototype. Further, as much as 90 percent of a system’s functioning is \\ndevoted to handling exceptional cases (McConnell, 1996). Prototypes are designed \\nto handle only the typical cases, so exception handling must be added to the proto-\\ntype as it is converted to the production system. Clearly, the prototype captures only \\npart of the system requirements.\\nThrowaway Prototyping Unlike evolutionary prototyping, throwaway prototyping \\ndoes not preserve the prototype that has been developed. With throwaway prototyp-\\ning, there is never any intention to convert the prototype into a working system. \\nInstead, the prototype is developed quickly to demonstrate some aspect of a system \\ndesign that is unclear or to help users decide among different features or interface \\ncharacteristics. Once the uncertainty the prototype was created to address has been \\nreduced, the prototype can be discarded, and the principles learned from its cre-\\nation and testing can then become part of the requirements determination.\\nPrototyping is most useful for requirements determination when\\n•\\t user requirements are not clear or well understood, which is often the case for \\ntotally new systems or systems that support decision making;\\n•\\t one or a few users and other stakeholders are involved with the system;\\n•\\t possible designs are complex and require concrete form to fully evaluate;\\n•\\t communication problems have existed in the past between users and analysts \\nand both parties want to be sure that system requirements are as specific as \\npossible; and\\n•\\t tools (such as form and report generators) and data are readily available to \\nrapidly build working systems.\\nPrototyping also has some drawbacks as a tool for requirements determination. \\nThese include the following:\\n•\\t Prototypes have a tendency to avoid creating formal documentation of system \\nrequirements, which can then make the system more difficult to develop into a \\nfully working system.\\n•\\t Prototypes can become very idiosyncratic to the initial user and difficult to \\ndiffuse or adapt to other potential users.\\n•\\t Prototypes are often built as stand-alone systems, thus ignoring issues of sharing \\ndata and interactions with other existing systems, as well as issues with scaling up \\napplications.\\n•\\t Checks in the SDLC are bypassed so that some more subtle, but still important, \\nsystem requirements might be forgotten (e.g., security, some data entry controls, \\nor standardization of data across systems).\\nInitial Concept Design and\\nImplement\\nInitial Prototype\\nReﬁne Prototype\\nuntil Acceptable\\nComplete and\\nRelease\\nPrototype\\nFigure 6-8 \\nMcConnell’s evolutionary prototyping \\nmodel'),\n",

But most of what you have learned has \\ntraditionally been applied to systems development projects that involve automating \\nexisting processes. Analysts use system requirements determination to understand \\ncurrent problems and opportunities, as well as to determine what is needed and de-\\nsired in future systems. Typically, the current way of doing things has a large impact on \\nthe new system. In some organizations, though, management is looking for new ways \\nto perform current tasks. These new ways may be radically different from how things \\nare done now, but the payoffs may be enormous: Fewer people may be needed to do \\nthe same work, relationships with customers may improve dramatically, and processes \\nmay become much more efficient and effective, all of which can result in increased \\nprofits. The overall process by which current methods are replaced with radically new \\nmethods is generally referred to as business process reengineering (BPR). Although \\nthe term BPR is usually associated with a management fad that occurred in the 1990s, \\nbusinesses remain vitally interested in business processes and how to improve them \\n(Sharp and McDermott, 2001). Even if the term business process reengineering may seem \\ndated to some, process orientation remains a lasting legacy of the BPR movement.\\nTo better understand BPR, consider the following analogy. Suppose you are a \\nsuccessful European golfer who has tuned your game to fit the style of golf courses \\nand weather in Europe. You have learned how to control the flight of the ball in \\nheavy winds, roll the ball on wide open greens, putt on large and undulating greens, \\nand aim at a target without the aid of the landscaping common on North American \\ncourses. When you come to the United States to make your fortune on the US tour, \\nyou discover that incrementally improving your putting, driving accuracy, and sand \\nshots will help, but the new competitive environment is simply not suited to your style \\nof the game. You need to reengineer your whole approach, learning how to aim at \\ntargets, spin and stop a ball on the green, and manage the distractions of crowds and \\nthe press. If you are good enough, you may survive, but without reengineering, you \\nwill never be a winner.\\nJust as the competitiveness of golf forces good players to adapt their games to \\nchanging conditions, the competitiveness of our global economy has driven most \\ncompanies into a mode of continuously improving the quality of their products and \\nservices (Dobyns and Crawford-Mason, 1991). Organizations realize that creatively \\nusing information technologies can yield significant improvements in most business \\nprocesses. The idea behind BPR is not just to improve each business process, but, in a \\nsystems modeling sense, to reorganize the complete flow of data in major sections of \\nan organization to eliminate unnecessary steps, achieve synergies among previously \\nseparate steps, and become more responsive to future changes. Companies such as \\nIBM, Procter & Gamble, Walmart, and Ford are actively pursuing BPR efforts and \\nhave had great success. Yet many other companies have found difficulty in apply-\\ning BPR principles (Moad, 1994). Nonetheless, BPR concepts are actively applied in \\nboth corporate strategic planning and information systems planning as a way to radi-\\ncally improve business processes (as described in Chapter 4).\\nBPR advocates suggest that radical increases in the quality of business processes \\ncan be achieved through creative application of information technologies. BPR advo-\\ncates also suggest that radical improvement cannot be achieved by tweaking existing \\nprocesses but rather by using a clean sheet of paper and asking, “If we were a new \\norganization, how would we accomplish this activity?” Changing the way work is per-\\nformed also changes the way information is shared and stored, which means that the \\nresults of many BPR efforts are the development of information system maintenance \\nrequests or requests for system replacement. It is likely that you will encounter or \\nhave encountered BPR initiatives in your own organization.\\nBusiness process \\n reengineering (BPr)\\nThe search for, and implementation of, \\nradical change in business processes to \\nachieve breakthrough improvements in \\nproducts and services.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\ASUS\\\\Desktop\\\\AI powered chatbot\\\\Data\\\\SAD.pdf', 'page': 192}, page_content='168 Part III   AnAlysis\\nidentifying Processes to reengineer\\nA first step in any BPR effort relates to understanding what processes to change. \\nTo do this, you must first understand which processes represent the key business \\nprocesses for the organization. Key business processes are the structured set of mea-\\nsurable activities designed to produce a specific output for a particular customer or \\nmarket. The important aspect of this definition is that key processes are focused on \\nsome type of organizational outcome, such as the creation of a product or the deliv-\\nery of a service. Key business processes are also customer focused. In other words, key \\nbusiness processes would include all activities used to design, build, deliver, support, \\nand service a particular product for a particular customer. BPR efforts, therefore, \\nfirst try to understand those activities that are part of the organization’s key business \\nprocesses and then alter the sequence and structure of activities to achieve radical \\nimprovements in speed, quality, and customer satisfaction. The same techniques you \\nlearned to use for systems requirement determination can be used to discover and \\nunderstand key business processes. Interviewing key individuals, observing activities, \\nreading and studying organizational documents, and conducting JADs can all be \\nused to find and fathom key business processes.\\nAfter identifying key business processes, the next step is to identify specific ac-\\ntivities that can be radically improved through reengineering. Hammer and Champy \\n(1993), who are most closely identified with the term BPR and the process itself, sug-\\ngest asking three questions to identify activities for radical change:\\n1. How important is the activity to delivering an outcome?\\n2. How feasible is changing the activity?\\n3. How dysfunctional is the activity?\\nThe answers to these questions provide guidance for selecting which activi-\\nties to change. Those activities deemed important, changeable, yet dysfunctional, \\nare primary candidates. To identify dysfunctional activities, they suggest you look \\nfor activities where there are excessive information exchanges between individuals, \\nwhere information is redundantly recorded or needs to be rekeyed, where there are \\nexcessive inventory buffers or inspections, and where there is a lot of rework or com-\\nplexity. Many of the tools and techniques for modeling data, processes, events, and \\nlogic within the IS development process are also being applied to model business \\nprocesses within BPR efforts (see Davenport, 1993). Thus, the skills of a systems ana-\\nlyst are often central to many BPR efforts.\\nDisruptive technologies\\nOnce key business processes and activities have been identified, information technol-\\nogies must be applied to radically improve business processes. To do this, Hammer \\nand Champy (1993) suggest that organizations think “inductively” about information \\ntechnology. Induction is the process of reasoning from the specific to the general, \\nwhich means that managers must learn the power of new technologies and think of \\ninnovative ways to alter the way work is done. This is contrary to deductive thinking, \\nwhere problems are first identified and solutions are then formulated.\\nHammer and Champy suggest that managers especially consider disruptive \\ntechnologies when applying deductive thinking. Disruptive technologies are those \\nthat enable breaking long-held business rules that inhibit organizations from making \\nradical business changes. For example, Procter & Gamble (P&G), the huge consumer \\nproducts company, uses information technology to “innovate innovation” (Teresko, \\n2004). Technology helps different organizational units work together seamlessly on \\nnew products. P&G also uses computer simulations to expedite product design and \\ntest potential products with consumers early in the design process. Table 6-6 shows \\nseveral long-held business rules and beliefs that constrain organizations from making \\nradical process improvements. For example, the first rule suggests that information \\nKey business processes\\nThe structured, measured set of activities \\ndesigned to produce a specific output for a \\nparticular customer or market.\\nDisruptive technologies\\nTechnologies that enable breaking long-\\nheld business rules that inhibit organizations \\nfrom making radical business changes.'),\n",

However, the advent of distributed databases \\n(see Chapter 12) and pervasive wireless networking have “disrupted” this long-held \\nbusiness belief.\\nrequirements DeterminAtion using Agile \\nmethoDologies\\nYou’ve already learned about many different ways to determine the requirements for \\na system. Yet new methods and techniques are constantly being developed. Three \\nmore requirements determination techniques are presented in this section. The first \\nis continual user involvement in the development process, a technique that works \\nespecially well with small and dedicated development teams. The second approach \\nis a JAD-like process called Agile Usage-Centered Design. The third approach is the \\nPlanning Game, which was developed as part of eXtreme Programming.\\nContinual user involvement\\nIn Chapter 1, you read about the criticisms of the traditional waterfall SDLC. One \\nof those criticisms was that the waterfall SDLC allowed users to be involved in the \\ndevelopment process only in the early stages of analysis. Once requirements had \\nbeen gathered from them, the users were not involved again in the process until \\nthe system was being installed and they were asked to sign off on it. Typically, by the \\ntime the users saw the system again, it was nothing like what they had imagined. \\nAlso, given how their business processes had changed since analysis ended, the sys-\\ntem most likely did not adequately address user needs. This view of the traditional \\nwaterfall SDLC and user involvement is a stereotype of the process, and it does not \\ndescribe every systems development project that used the waterfall model. However, \\nlimited user involvement has been common enough to be perceived as a real and \\nserious problem in systems development.\\nOne approach to the problem of limited user involvement is to involve the users \\ncontinually, throughout the entire analysis and design process. Such an approach \\nworks best when development can follow the analysis–design–code–test cycle favored \\nby the Agile Methodologies (Figure 6-9), because the user can provide information on \\nrequirements and then watch and evaluate as those requirements are designed, coded, \\nand tested. This iterative process can continue through several cycles, until most of \\nthe major functionality of the system has been developed.

The system was \\nintended to support engineers who customize plane configurations for customers, \\nallowing them to analyze all 50,000 wires that can possibly be installed on a 757. A \\nprevious attempt at building a similar system took over three years, and the resulting \\nsystem was never used. The second attempt, relying on Agile Methodologies, resulted \\nin a system that was in production after only six weeks. One of the keys to success \\nwas a user liaison who spent half of his time with the small development team and \\nhalf with the other end users. In addition to following the analysis–design–code–test \\ncycle, the team also had weekly production releases. The user liaison was involved \\nevery step of the way. Obviously, for such a requirements determination to succeed, \\nthe user who works with the development team must be very knowledgeable, but he \\nor she must also be in a position to give up his or her normal business responsibilities \\nin order to become heavily involved in the system’s development.\\nAgile usage-Centered Design\\nContinual user involvement in systems development is an excellent way to ensure \\nthat requirements are captured accurately and immediately implemented in system \\ndesign. However, such constant interaction works best when the development team \\nis small, as was the case in the Boeing example. Also, it is not always possible to have \\ncontinual access to users for the duration of a development project. Thus, Agile de-\\nvelopers have come up with other means for effectively involving users in the re-\\nquirements determination process. One such method is called Agile Usage-Centered \\nDesign, originally developed by Larry Constantine (2002) and adapted for Agile \\nMethodologies by Jeff Patton (2002). Patton describes the process in nine steps, \\nwhich we have adapted and presented as eight steps in Table 6-7.\\nNotice how similar the overall process is to a JAD meeting. All of the experts \\nare gathered together and work with the help of the facilitator. What is unique about \\nthe Agile Usage-Centered Design is the process that supports it, which focuses on \\nuser roles, user goals, and the tasks necessary to achieve those goals. Then, tasks are \\ngrouped and turned into paper-and-pencil prototypes before the meeting is over. \\nRequirements captured from users and developers are captured as prototyped  system \\nscreens. Patton (2002) believes that the two most effective aspects of this approach \\nare the venting session, which lets everyone get their complaints out in the open, and \\nCode\\nAnalyze\\nTest Design\\nFigure 6-9 \\nThe iterative analysis–design–code–test \\ncycle'),\n",

As with any \\nanalysis and design process or technique, however, Agile Usage-Centered Design will \\nnot work for every project or every company.\\nthe Planning game from eXtreme Programming\\nYou read about eXtreme Programming in Chapter 1, and you know that it is an \\napproach to software development put together by Kent Beck (Beck and Andres, \\n2004). You also know that it is distinguished by its short cycles, its incremental plan-\\nning approach, its focus on automated tests written by programmers and customers \\nto monitor the process of development, and its reliance on an evolutionary approach \\nto development that lasts throughout the lifetime of the system. One of the key em-\\nphases of eXtreme Programming is its use of two-person programming teams and \\nhaving a customer on-site during the development process. The relevant parts of \\neXtreme Programming that relate to requirements determination are (1) how plan-\\nning, analysis, design, and construction are all fused together into a single phase of \\nactivity and (2) its unique way of capturing and presenting system requirements and \\ndesign specifications. All phases of the life cycle converge into a series of activities \\nbased on the basic processes of coding, testing, listening, and designing.\\nWhat is of interest here, however, is the way requirements and specifications \\nare dealt with. Both of these activities take place in what Beck calls the “Planning \\nGame.” The Planning Game is really just a stylized approach to development that \\nseeks to maximize fruitful interaction between those who need a new system and \\nthose who build it. The players in the Planning Game, then, are Business and \\nDevelopment. Business is the customer and is ideally represented by someone who \\nknows the processes to be supported by the system being developed. Development \\nis represented by those actually designing and constructing the system. The game \\npieces are what Beck calls “Story Cards.” These cards are created by Business and \\ncontain a description of a procedure or feature to be included in the system. Each \\ncard is dated and numbered and has space on it for tracking its status throughout the \\ndevelopment effort.\\nTable 6-7  Steps in the agile Usage-Centered Design Method for Requirements Determination\\n1. Gather a group of people, including analysts, users, programmers, and testing staff, and \\nsequester them in a room to collaborate on this design. Include a facilitator who knows this \\nprocess.\\n2. Give everyone a chance to vent about the current system and to talk about the features \\neveryone wants in the new system. Record all of the complaints and suggestions for change \\non whiteboards or flip charts for everyone to see.\\n3. Determine what the most important user roles would be. Determine who will be using the \\nsystem and what their goals are for using the system. Write the roles on 3 × 5 cards. Sort \\nthe\\xa0cards so that similar roles are close to each other. Patton (2002) calls this a role model.\\n4. Determine what tasks user roles will have to complete in order to achieve their goals. Write \\nthese down on 3 × 5 cards. Order tasks by importance and then by frequency. Place the \\ncards\\xa0together based on how similar the tasks are to each other. Patton calls this a task model.\\n5. Task cards will be grouped together on the table based on their similarity. Grab a stack of \\ncards. This is called an interaction context.\\n6. For each task card in the interaction context, write a description of the task directly on \\nthe task card. List the steps that are necessary to complete the task. Keep the descriptions \\nconversational to make them easy to read. Simplify.\\n7. Treat each stack as a tentative set of tasks to be supported by a single aspect of the user \\ninterface, such as a screen, page, or dialogue, and create a paper-and-pencil prototype for \\nthat part of the interface. Show the basic size and placement of the screen components.\\n8. Take on a user role and step through each task in the interaction context as modeled in \\nthe paper-and-pencil prototype. Make sure the user role can achieve its goals by using the \\nprototype. Refine the prototype accordingly.'),\n",

In exploration, Business creates a Story Card for something it wants \\nthe new system to do. Development responds with an estimation of how long it would \\ntake to implement the procedure. At this point, it may make sense to split a Story \\nCard into multiple Story Cards, as the scope of features and procedures becomes \\nmore clear during discussion. In the commitment phase, Business sorts Story Cards \\ninto three stacks: one for essential features, one for features that are not essential but \\nwould still add value, and one for features that would be nice to have. Development \\nthen sorts Story Cards according to risk, based on how well they can estimate the \\ntime needed to develop each feature. Business then selects the cards that will be \\nincluded in the next release of the product. In the final phase, steering, Business \\nhas a chance to see how the development process is progressing and to work with \\nDevelopment to adjust the plan accordingly. Steering can take place as often as once \\nevery three weeks.\\nThe Planning Game between Business and Development is followed by the \\nIteration Planning Game, played only by programmers. Instead of Story Cards, pro-\\ngrammers write Task Cards, which are based on Story Cards. Typically, several Task \\nCards are generated for each Story Card. The Iteration Planning Game has the same \\nthree phases as the Planning Game: exploration, commitment, and steering. During \\nexploration, programmers convert Story Cards into Task Cards. During commitment, \\nthey accept responsibility for tasks and balance their workloads. During steering, the \\nprogrammers write the code for the feature and test it. If it works, they integrate the \\nfeature into the product being developed. The Iteration Planning Game takes place \\nduring the time intervals between steering phase meetings in the Planning Game.\\nYou can see how the Planning Game is similar in some ways to Agile Usage-\\nCentered Design. Both rely on participation by users, rely on cards as communica-\\ntion devices, and focus on tasks the system being designed is supposed to perform. \\nAlthough these approaches differ from some of the more traditional ways of deter-\\nmining requirements, such as interviews and prototyping, many of the core prin-\\nciples are the same.

Their goal was to \\ncollect requirements on the following items:\\n•\\t System Layout and Navigation Characteristics\\n•\\t WebStore and Site Management System Capabilities\\n•\\t Customer and Inventory Information\\n•\\t System Prototype Evolution\\nIn the remainder of this section, we briefly highlight the outcomes of the JAD \\nsession.\\nSystem Layout and Navigation Characteristics  As part of the process of prepar -\\ning for the JAD session, all participants were asked to visit several established re-\\ntail websites, including www.amazon.com, www.landsend.com, www.sony.com, and www.\\npier1.com. At the JAD session, participants were asked to identify characteristics \\nof these sites that they found appealing and those characteristics that they found \\ncumbersome. This allowed participants to identify and discuss those features that \\nthey wanted the WebStore to possess. The outcomes of this activity are summarized \\nin Table 6-8.\\nTable 6-8  Desired layout and Navigation Feature of WebStore\\nLayout and Design •\\tNavigation menu and logo placement should remain consistent \\nthroughout the entire site (this allows users to maintain familiarity while \\nusing the site and minimizes users who get “lost” in the site)\\n•\\tGraphics should be lightweight to allow for quick page display\\n•\\tText should be used over graphics whenever possible\\nNavigation •\\tAny section of the store should be accessible from any other section via \\nthe navigation menu\\n•\\tUsers should always be aware of what section they are currently in'),\n",

To assist in this process, systems analysts from \\nthe Information Systems Department developed a draft skeleton of the WebStore. \\nThis skeleton was based on the types of screens common to and capabilities of \\npopular retail websites. For example, many retail websites have a “shopping cart” \\nfeature that allows customers to accumulate multiple items before checking out \\nrather than buying a single item at a time. After some discussion, the participants \\nagreed that the system structure shown in Table 6-9 would form the foundation for the \\nWebStore system.\\nIn addition to the WebStore capabilities, members of the Marketing and Sales \\nDepartment described several reports that would be necessary to effectively manage \\ncustomer accounts and sales transactions. In addition, the department wants to be \\nable to conduct detailed analyses of site visitors, sales tracking, and so on. Members \\nof the Operations Department expressed a need to easily update the product catalog. \\nThese collective requests and activities were organized into a system design structure \\ncalled the Site Management System, which is summarized in Table 6-9. The structures \\nof both the WebStore and Site Management Systems will be given to the Information \\nSystems Department as the baseline for further analysis and design activities.\\nCustomer and Inventory Information  The WebStore will be designed to support \\nthe furniture purchases of three distinct types of customers:\\n•\\t Corporate customers\\n•\\t Home office customers\\n•\\t Student customers\\nTo effectively track the sales to these different types of customers, distinct informa-\\ntion must be captured and stored by the system. Table 6-10 summarizes this informa-\\ntion for each customer type that was identified during the JAD session. In addition \\nto the customer information, information about the products ordered must also be \\ncaptured and stored. Orders reflect the range of product information that must be \\nspecified to execute a sales transaction. Thus, in addition to capturing the customer \\ninformation, product and sales data must also be captured and stored.

Chapter 6 has focused on requirements determina-\\ntion, the gathering of information about current systems \\nand the need for replacement systems. Chapters 7 and 8 \\nwill address techniques for structuring the requirements \\nelicited during requirements determination.\\nFor requirements determination, the traditional \\nsources of information about a system include interviews; \\nobservation; group interviews; and procedures, forms, and \\nother useful documents. Often many or even all of these \\nsources are used to gather perspectives on the adequacy \\nof current systems and the requirements for replacement \\nsystems. Each form of information collection has its advan-\\ntages and disadvantages. Selecting the methods to use de-\\npends on the need for rich or thorough information, the \\ntime and budget available, the need to probe deeper once \\ninitial information is collected, the need for confiden-\\ntiality for those providing assessments of system require-\\nments, the desire to get people involved and committed to \\na project, and the potential audience from which require-\\nments should be collected.\\nBoth open- and closed-ended questions can be \\nposed during interviews. In either case, you must be very \\nprecise in formulating a question in order to avoid ambi-\\nguity and to ensure a proper response. During observa-\\ntion you must try not to intrude or interfere with normal \\nbusiness activities so that the people being observed do \\nnot modify their activities from normal processes. The \\nresults of all requirements-gathering methods should be \\ncompared because there may be differences between the \\nformal or official system and the way people actually work, \\nthe informal system.\\nYou also learned about contemporary methods to \\ncollect requirements information, many of which make \\nuse of information systems. JAD begins with the idea of \\nthe group interview and adds structure and a JAD ses-\\nsion leader to it. Typical JAD participants include the ses-\\nsion leader, a scribe, key users, managers, a sponsor, and \\nsystems analysts. JAD sessions are usually held off-site and \\nmay last as long as one week.\\nSystems analysis is increasingly performed with com-\\nputer assistance, as is the case in using CASE tools and \\nprototyping to support requirements determination. As \\npart of the prototyping process, users and analysts work \\nclosely together to determine requirements that the ana-\\nlyst then builds into a model. The analyst and user then \\nwork together to revise the model until it is close to what \\nthe user desires.\\nBPR is an approach to radically changing business \\nprocesses. BPR efforts are a source of new information re-\\nquirements. Information systems and technologies often \\nenable BPR by allowing an organization to eliminate or \\nrelax constraints on traditional business rules. Agile re-\\nquirements determination techniques are another contem-\\nporary approach to figuring out what a new or improved \\nsystem is supposed to do. Continual customer involvement \\nrelies on high levels of user participation. Agile Usage-\\nCentered Design and the Planning Game rely on novel in-\\nteractions between users and developers to uncover basic \\ntasks and features the new system should include.\\nMost of the same techniques used for requirements \\ndetermination for traditional systems can also be fruit-\\nfully applied to the development of Internet applications. \\nAccurately capturing requirements in a timely manner for \\nInternet applications is just as important as for more tradi-\\ntional systems.\\nThe result of requirements determination is a thor -\\nough set of information, including some charts, that de-\\nscribes the current systems being studied and the need \\nfor new and different capabilities to be included in the \\nreplacement systems. This information, however, is not \\nin a form that makes analysis of true problems and clear \\nstatements of new features possible. Thus, you and other \\nanalysts will study this information and structure it into \\nstandard formats suitable for identifying problems and un-\\nambiguously describing the specifications for new systems. \\nWe discuss a variety of popular techniques for structuring \\nrequirements in the next two chapters.\\nKey TermS\\n 6.1 Business process reengineering \\n(BPR)\\n 6.2 Closed-ended questions\\n 6.3 Disruptive technologies\\n 6.4 Formal system\\n 6.5 Informal system\\n 6.6 JAD session leader\\n 6.7 Joint Application  \\nDesign (JAD)\\n 6.8 Key business processes\\n 6.9 Nominal Group Technique  \\n(NGT)\\n 6.10 Open-ended questions\\n 6.11 Prototyping\\n 6.12 Scribe'),\n",

You must first do some inter -\\nviewing, preferably a lot of it, because interviewing skills \\nimprove only with experience. To get an idea of what in-\\nterviewing is like, try the following: Find three friends or \\nclassmates to help you complete this exercise. Organize \\nyourselves into pairs. Write down a series of questions \\nyou can use to find out about a job your partner now has \\nor once held. You decide what questions to use, but at a \\nminimum, you must find out the following: (1) the job’s \\ntitle; (2) the job’s responsibilities; (3) who your partner re-\\nported to; (4) who reported to your partner, if anyone did; \\nand (5) what information your partner used to do his or \\nher job. At the same time, your partner should be prepar-\\ning questions to ask you about a job you had. Now conduct \\nthe interview. Take careful notes. Organize what you find \\ninto a clear form that another person could understand. \\nNow repeat the process, but this time, your partner inter-\\nviews you.\\nWhile the two of you have been interviewing each \\nother, your two other friends should have been doing the \\nsame thing. When all four of you are done, switch partners \\nand repeat the entire process. When you are all done, each \\nof you should have interviewed two people, and each of you \\nshould have been interviewed by two people. Now, you and \\nthe person who interviewed your original partner should \\ncompare your findings. Most likely, your findings will not \\nbe identical to what the other person found. If your find-\\nings differ, discover why. Did you use the same questions? \\nDid the other person do a more thorough job of inter-\\nviewing your first partner because it was the second time \\nhe or she had conducted an interview? Did you both ask \\nfollow-up questions? Did you both spend about the same \\namount of time on the interview? Prepare a report with this \\nperson about why your findings differed. Now find both of \\nthe people who interviewed you. Does one set of findings \\ndiffer from the other? If so, try to figure out why. Did one \\nof them (or both of them) misrepresent or misunderstand \\nwhat you told them? Each person should now write a report \\non their experience, using it to explain why interviews are \\nsometimes inconsistent and inaccurate and why having two \\npeople interview someone on a topic is better than having \\njust one person do the interview. Explain the implications \\nof what you have learned for the requirements determina-\\ntion subphase of the systems development life cycle.\\n 6.35 Choose a work team at your work or university and inter -\\nview them in a group setting. Ask them about their current \\nsystem (whether computer-based or not) for performing \\ntheir work. Ask each of them what information they use \\nand/or need and from where/whom they get it. Was this \\na useful method for you to learn about their work? Why or \\nwhy not? What comparative advantages does this method \\nprovide as compared to one-on-one interviews with each \\nteam member? What comparative disadvantages?\\n 6.36 For the same work team you used in Field Exercise 6-35, \\nexamine copies of any relevant written documentation \\n(e.g., written procedures, forms, reports, system documen-\\ntation). Are any of these forms of written documentation \\nmissing? Why? With what consequences? To what extent \\ndoes this written documentation fit with the information \\nyou received in the group interview?\\n 6.37 Interview systems analysts, users, and managers who have \\nbeen involved in JAD sessions. Determine the location, \\nstructure, and outcomes of each of their JAD sessions. \\nElicit their evaluations of their sessions. Were they produc-\\ntive? Why or why not?\\n 6.38 Survey the literature on JAD in the academic and popular \\npress and determine the “state of the art.” How is JAD be-\\ning used to help determine system requirements? Is using \\nJAD for this process beneficial? Why or why not? Present \\nyour analysis to the IS manager at your work or at your uni-\\nversity. Does your analysis of JAD fit with his or her percep-\\ntion? Why or why not? Is he or she currently using JAD, or \\na JAD-like method, for determining system requirements? \\nWhy or why not?\\n 6.39 With the help of other students or your instructor, con-\\ntact someone in an organization who has carried out a \\nBPR study. What effects did this study have on information \\nsystems? In what ways did information technology, espe-\\ncially disruptive technologies, facilitate making the radical \\nchanges discovered in the BPR study?\\n 6.40 Find an organization that uses Agile techniques for re-\\nquirements determination. What techniques do they use? \\nHow did they discover them? What did they use before? \\nWhat is their evaluation of the Agile techniques they use?\\nmisunderstood any of your questions and, if so, rewrite the \\nquestions to be less ambiguous.\\n 6.30 Figure 6-2 shows part of a guide for an interview. How \\nmight an interview guide differ when a group interview is \\nto be conducted?\\n 6.31 Group interviews and JADs are very powerful ways to col-\\nlect system requirements, but special problems arise dur -\\ning group requirements collection sessions. Summarize \\nthe special interviewing and group problems that arise in \\nsuch group sessions and suggest ways that you, as a group \\ninterviewer or group facilitator, might deal with these \\nproblems.\\n 6.32 Review the material in Chapter 4 on corporate and infor -\\nmation systems strategic planning. How are these processes \\ndifferent from BPR?

He spent much of his time planning and \\nconducting interviews with key stakeholders inside the \\ncompany. He also worked with the marketing group to \\nput together some focus groups made up of loyal custom-\\ners, to get some ideas about what they would value in a \\ncustomer loyalty program. Jim had also spent some time \\nstudying customer loyalty programs at other big retail \\nchains and those in other industries as well, such as the \\nairlines, which are known for their extensive customer \\nloyalty programs. As project manager, he also supervised \\nthe efforts of his team members. Together, they collected \\na great deal of data. Jim had just finished creating a high-\\nlevel summary of the information into a table he could \\nsend to his team members (PE Table 6-1).\\nas it might have been to develop a unique system just for \\nPetrie, there was little point in reinventing the wheel. The \\nIT staff would customize the system interface, and there \\nwould be lots of work for Sanjay’s staff in integrating the \\nnew system and its related components with Petrie’s ex-\\nisting systems, but the core of the system would have al-\\nready been developed by someone else.\\nJust as he was finishing the e-mail he would send to \\nhis team about the new system’s requirements and con-\\nstraints, he received a new message from Sanjay. He had \\nasked Sanjay to take the lead in scouting out existing cus-\\ntomer loyalty systems that Petrie could license. Sanjay \\nconducted a preliminary investigation that was now com-\\nplete. His e-mail contained the descriptions of three of the \\nsystems he found and studied (PE Table 6-2). Obviously, \\nJim and his team would need to have a lot more informa-\\ntion about these alternatives, but Jim was intrigued by the \\npossibilities. He sent a reply to Sanjay, asking him to pass \\nthe alternatives on to the team and to prepare a briefing \\nfor the team that would include more detailed informa-\\ntion about each alternative.\\nFrom the list of requirements, it was clear that he and \\nhis team did not favor building a system from scratch in-\\nhouse.

Data flow diagrams also show the pro-\\ncesses that change or transform data. Because data flow \\ndiagrams concentrate on the movement of data between \\nprocesses, these diagrams are called process models.\\nAs its name indicates, a data flow diagram is a graph-\\nical tool that allows analysts (and users, for that matter) \\nto depict the flow of data in an information system. The \\nsystem can be physical or logical, manual or computer-\\nbased. In this chapter, you will learn how to draw and re-\\nvise data flow diagrams. We present the basic symbols used \\nin such diagrams and a set of rules that govern how these \\ndiagrams are drawn. You will also learn about what to do \\nand what not to do when drawing data flow diagrams. Two \\nimportant concepts related to data flow diagrams are also \\npresented: balancing and decomposition. Toward the end \\nof the chapter, we present the use of data flow diagrams \\nas part of the analysis of an information system and as a \\ntool for supporting business process reengineering. You \\nwill also learn how process modeling is important for the \\nanalysis of electronic commerce applications. Also in this \\nchapter, you will learn about decision tables. Decision \\ntables allow you to represent the conditional logic that is \\npart of some data flow diagram processes. Finally, at the \\nend of the chapter, we have included special sections on \\nan object-oriented development approach to process and \\nlogic modeling. These sections cover use cases, activity di-\\nagrams, and sequence diagrams. We have also included an \\nappendix on business process modeling.\\nProcess Modeling\\nProcess modeling involves graphically representing the \\nfunctions, or processes, that capture, manipulate, store, \\nand distribute data between a system and its environment \\nand between components within a system.

Over the years, several dif-\\nferent tools have been developed for process modeling. In this chapter, we focus on \\nDFDs, the traditional process modeling technique of structured analysis and design \\nand one of the techniques most frequently used today for process modeling. We also \\nintroduce you to decision tables, a well-known way to model the conditional logic \\ncontained in many DFD processes.\\nModeling a system’s Process for structured Analysis\\nAs Figure 7-1 shows, the analysis phase of the systems development life cycle has two \\nsubphases: requirements determination and requirements structuring. The analy-\\nsis team enters the requirements structuring phase with an abundance of informa-\\ntion gathered during the requirements determination phase. During requirements \\nstructuring, you and the other team members must organize the information into a \\nmeaningful representation of the information system that currently exists and of the \\nrequirements desired in a replacement system. In addition to modeling the process-\\ning elements of an information system and how data are transformed in the system, \\nyou must also model the processing logic (decision tables) and the structure of data \\nwithin the system (Chapter 8). For traditional structured analysis, a process model is \\nonly one of three major complementary views of an information system. Together, \\nprocess, logic, and data models provide a thorough specification of an information \\nsystem and, with the proper supporting tools, also provide the basis for the automatic \\ngeneration of many working information system components.\\ndeliverables and outcomes\\nIn structured analysis, the primary deliverables from process modeling are a set of co-\\nherent, interrelated DFDs. Table 7-1 provides a more detailed list of the deliverables \\nthat result when DFDs are used to study and document a system’s processes. First, a \\ncontext diagram shows the scope of the system, indicating which elements are inside \\nand which are outside the system. Second, DFDs of the system specify which pro-\\ncesses move and transform data, accepting inputs and producing outputs. These dia-\\ngrams are developed with sufficient detail to understand the current system and to \\nData flow diagram (DFD)\\nA picture of the movement of data between \\nexternal entities and the processes and \\ndata stores within a system.\\nDesignImplementation\\nPlanning\\nMaintenance Analysis Requirements Determination\\nRequirements Structuring\\nFigure 7-1 \\nSystems development life cycle with the \\nanalysis phase highlighted'),\n",

Finally, \\nentries for all of the objects included in all of the diagrams are included in the proj-\\nect dictionary or CASE repository. This logical progression of deliverables allows you \\nto understand the existing system. You can then abstract this system into its essential \\nelements to show how the new system should meet the information-processing re-\\nquirements identified during requirements determination. Remember, the deliver-\\nables of process modeling are simply stating what you learned during requirements \\ndetermination; in later steps in the systems development life cycle, you and other \\nproject team members will make decisions on exactly how the new system will deliver \\nthese new requirements in specific manual and automated functions. Because re-\\nquirements determination and structuring are often parallel steps, DFDs evolve from \\nthe more general to the more detailed as current and replacement systems are better \\nunderstood.\\nDFDs provide notation as well as illustrate important concepts about the move-\\nment of data between manual and automated steps, and they offer a way to depict \\nwork flow in an organization. DFDs continue to be beneficial to information systems \\nprofessionals as tools for both analysis and communication. For that reason, we de-\\nvote almost an entire chapter to DFDs, but we complement our coverage of DFDs \\nwith an introduction to use cases and use case diagrams in the chapter appendix on \\nuse case.\\ndAtA Flow diAgrAMMing MechAnics\\nDFDs are versatile diagramming tools. With only four symbols, you can use DFDs to \\nrepresent both physical and logical information systems. DFDs are not as good as \\nflowcharts for depicting the details of physical systems; on the other hand, flowcharts \\nare not very useful for depicting purely logical information flows. In fact, flowchart-\\ning has been criticized by proponents of structured analysis and design because it \\nis too physically oriented. Flowcharting symbols primarily represent physical com-\\nputing equipment, such as terminals and permanent storage. One continual criti-\\ncism of system flowcharts has been that overreliance on such charts tends to result \\nin premature physical system design. Consistent with the incremental commitment \\nphilosophy of the systems development life cycle (SDLC), you should wait to make \\ntechnology choices and to decide on physical characteristics of an information sys-\\ntem until you are sure all functional requirements are correct and accepted by users \\nand other stakeholders.\\nDFDs do not share this problem of premature physical design because they do \\nnot rely on any symbols to represent specific physical computing equipment. They \\nare also easier to use than flowcharts because they involve only four different symbols.\\ndefinitions and symbols\\nThere are two different standard sets of DFD symbols (see Figure 7-2); each set con-\\nsists of four symbols that represent the same things: data flows, data stores, processes, \\nand sources/sinks (or external entities). The set of symbols we will use in this book \\nwas devised by Gane and Sarson (1979). The other standard set was developed by \\nDeMarco (1979) and Yourdon (Yourdon and Constantine, 1979).\\nTable 7-1  Deliverables for Process Modeling\\n1. Context DFD\\n2.

A data flow could represent data on a customer order form or \\na payroll check; it could also represent the results of a query to a database, the con-\\ntents of a printed report, or data on a data entry computer display form. A data flow \\nis data that move together, so it can be composed of many individual pieces of data \\nthat are generated at the same time and that flow together to common destinations. \\nA data store is data at rest. A data store may represent one of many different physical \\nlocations for data; for example, a file folder, one or more computer-based file(s), or \\na notebook. To understand data movement and handling in a system, it is not impor-\\ntant to understand the system’s physical configuration. A data store might contain \\ndata about customers, students, customer orders, or supplier invoices. A process is \\nthe work or actions performed on data so that they are transformed, stored, or dis-\\ntributed. When modeling the data processing of a system, it does not matter whether \\na process is performed manually or by a computer. Finally, a source/sink is the origin \\nand/or destination of the data. Sources/sinks are sometimes referred to as external \\nentities because they are outside the system. Once processed, data or information \\nleave the system and go to some other place. Because sources and sinks are outside \\nthe system we are studying, many of the characteristics of sources and sinks are of no \\ninterest to us. In particular, we do not consider the following:\\n•\\t Interactions that occur between sources and sinks\\n•\\t What a source or sink does with information or how it operates (i.e., a source or \\nsink is a “black box”)\\n•\\t How to control or redesign a source or sink because, from the perspective of \\nthe system we are studying, the data a sink receives and often what data a source \\nprovides are fixed\\n•\\t How to provide sources and sinks direct access to stored data because, as exter-\\nnal agents, they cannot directly access or manipulate data stored within the sys-\\ntem; that is, processes within the system must receive or distribute data between \\nthe system and its environment\\nThe symbols for each set of DFD conventions are presented in Figure 7-2. In \\nboth conventions, a data flow is depicted as an arrow. The arrow is labeled with a \\nmeaningful name for the data in motion; for example, Customer Order, Sales \\nReceipt, or Paycheck. The name represents the aggregation of all the individual el-\\nements of data moving as part of one packet, that is, all the data moving together \\nData store\\nData at rest, which may take the form of \\nmany different physical representations.\\nProcess\\nThe work or actions performed on data \\nso that they are transformed, stored, or \\ndistributed.\\nSource/sink\\nThe origin and/or destination of data; \\nsometimes referred to as external entities.\\nprocess\\ndata store\\nsource/sink\\ndata ﬂow\\nDeMarco and Yourdon\\nsymbols\\nGane and Sarson \\nsymbols\\nFigure 7-2 \\nComparison of DeMarco and Yourdon \\nand Gane and Sarson DFD symbol sets'),\n",

A square is used in both conventions for sources/sinks and has a \\nname that states what the external agent is, such as Customer, Teller, EPA Office, or \\nInventory Control System. The Gane and Sarson symbol for a process is a rectangle \\nwith rounded corners; it is a circle for DeMarco and Yourdon. The Gane and Sarson \\nrounded rectangle has a line drawn through the top. The upper portion is used to \\nindicate the number of the process. Inside the lower portion is a name for the pro-\\ncess, such as Generate Paycheck, Calculate Overtime Pay, or Compute Grade Point \\nAverage. The Gane and Sarson symbol for a data store is a rectangle that is missing its \\nright vertical side. At the left end is a small box used to number the data store, and \\ninside the main part of the rectangle is a meaningful label for the data store, such as \\nStudent File, Transcripts, or Roster of Classes. The DeMarco and Yourdon data store \\nsymbol consists of two parallel lines, which may be depicted horizontally or vertically.\\nAs stated earlier, sources/sinks are always outside the information system and \\ndefine the boundaries of the system. Data must originate outside a system from one \\nor more sources, and the system must produce information to one or more sinks \\n(these are principles of open systems, and almost every information system is an \\nopen system). If any data processing takes place inside the source/sink, it is of no \\ninterest because this processing takes place outside the system we are diagramming. \\nA source/sink might consist of the following:\\n•\\t Another organization or organization unit that sends data to or receives in-\\nformation from the system you are analyzing (e.g., a supplier or an academic \\ndepartment—in either case, the organization is external to the system you are \\nstudying)\\n•\\t A person inside or outside the business unit supported by the system you are \\nanalyzing who interacts with the system (e.g., a customer or loan officer)\\n•\\t Another information system with which the system you are analyzing exchanges \\ninformation\\nMany times students who are just learning how to use DFDs will become con-\\nfused as to whether something is a source/sink or a process within a system. This \\ndilemma occurs most often when the data flows in a system cross office or depart-\\nmental boundaries so that some processing occurs in one office and the processed \\ndata are moved to another office where additional processing occurs. Students are \\ntempted to identify the second office as a source/sink to emphasize the fact that \\nthe data have been moved from one physical location to another (Figure 7-3a). \\nHowever, we are not concerned with where the data are physically located. We are \\nmore interested in how they are moving through the system and how they are being \\nprocessed. If the processing of data in the other office may be automated by your \\nsystem or the handling of data there may be subject to redesign, then you should \\nrepresent the second office as one or more processes rather than as a source/sink \\n(Figure 7.3b).\\ndeveloping dFds: An example\\nTo illustrate how DFDs are used to model the logic of data flows in information sys-\\ntems, we will present and work through an example. Consider Hoosier Burger, a fic-\\ntional restaurant in Bloomington, Indiana, owned by Bob and Thelma Mellankamp. \\nSome are convinced that its hamburgers are the best in Bloomington, maybe even in \\nsouthern Indiana. Many people, especially Indiana University students and faculty, \\nfrequently eat at Hoosier Burger. The restaurant uses an information system that \\ntakes customer orders, sends the orders to the kitchen, monitors goods sold and in-\\nventory, and generates reports for management.\\nThe information system is depicted as a DFD in Figure 7-4. The highest-level \\nview of this system, shown in the figure, is called a context diagram. You will notice \\nthat this context diagram contains only one process, no data stores, four data flows, \\nand three sources/sinks. The single process, labeled 0, represents the entire system; \\nContext diagram\\nAn overview of an organizational system \\nthat shows the system boundaries, external \\nentities that interact with the system, and \\nthe major information flows between the \\nentities and the system.\\nHOOSIER\\nBURGER'),\n",

The main processes represent the major functions of the system, \\nand these major functions correspond to actions such as the following:\\n1. Capturing data from different sources (e.g., Process 1.0)\\n2. Maintaining data stores (e.g., Processes 2.0 and 3.0)\\n3. Producing and distributing data to different sinks (e.g., Process 4.0)\\n4. High-level descriptions of data transformation operations (e.g., Process 1.0)\\nThese major functions often correspond to the activities on the main system \\nmenu.\\nWe see that the system begins with an order from a customer, as was the case \\nwith the context diagram. In the first process, labeled 1.0, we see that the customer \\norder is processed. The result is four streams, or flows, of data: (1) the food order is \\ntransmitted to the kitchen, (2) the customer order is transformed into a list of goods \\nsold, (3) the customer order is transformed into inventory data, and (4) the process \\ngenerates a receipt for the customer.\\nNotice that the sources/sinks are the same in the context diagram and in this \\ndiagram: the customer, the kitchen, and the restaurant’s manager.

If the customer order was for two cheeseburgers, one order of \\nfries, and a large soft drink, each of these categories of goods sold in the data store \\nwould be incremented appropriately. The Daily Goods Sold Amounts are then used \\nas input to Process 4.0, Produce Management Reports. Similarly, the remaining \\ndata flow generated by Process 1.0, Inventory Data, serves as input for Process 3.0, \\nUpdate Inventory File. This process updates the Inventory File data store, based on \\nthe inventory that would have been used to create the customer order. For example, \\nan order of two cheeseburgers would mean that Hoosier Burger now has two fewer \\nhamburger patties, two fewer burger buns, and four fewer slices of American cheese. \\nThe Daily Inventory Depletion Amounts are then used as input to Process 4.0. The \\ndata flow leaving Process 4.0, Management Reports, goes to the sink Restaurant \\nManager.\\nFigure 7-5 illustrates several important concepts about information movement. \\nConsider the data flow Inventory Data moving from Process 1.0 to Process 3.0. We \\nknow from this diagram that Process 1.0 produces this data flow and that Process 3.0 \\nreceives it. However, we do not know the timing of when this data flow is produced, \\nhow frequently it is produced, or what volume of data is sent. Thus, this DFD hides \\nmany physical characteristics of the system it describes. We do know, however, that \\nthis data flow is needed by Process 3.0 and that Process 1.0 provides these needed \\ndata.\\nAlso implied by the Inventory Data data flow is that whenever Process 1.0 pro-\\nduces this flow, Process 3.0 must be ready to accept it. Thus, Processes 1.0 and 3.0 \\nare coupled with each other. In contrast, consider the link between Process 2.0 and \\nProcess 4.0. The output from Process 2.0, Formatted Goods Sold Data, is placed in \\na data store and, later, when Process 4.0 needs such data, it reads Daily Goods Sold \\nAmounts from this data store. In this case, Processes 2.0 and 4.0 are decoupled by \\nplacing a buffer, a data store, between them. Now, each of these processes can work \\nat their own pace, and Process 4.0 does not have to be ready to accept input at any \\ntime. Further, the Goods Sold File becomes a data resource that other processes \\ncould potentially draw upon for data.\\ndata Flow diagramming rules\\nYou must follow a set of rules when drawing DFDs. Unlike system flowcharts, these \\nrules allow you (or a CASE tool) to evaluate DFDs for correctness. The rules for \\nDFDs are listed in Table 7-2. Figure 7-6 illustrates incorrect ways to draw DFDs and \\nthe corresponding correct application of the rules. The rules that prescribe naming \\nconventions (rules C, G, I, and P) and those that explain how to interpret data flows \\nin and out of data stores (rules N and O) are not illustrated in Figure 7-6.\\nIn addition to the rules in Table 7-2, there are two DFD guidelines that often \\napply:\\n1. The inputs to a process are different from the outputs of that process. The reason is that \\nprocesses, because they have a purpose, typically transform inputs into outputs, \\nrather than simply pass the data through without some manipulation. What may \\nhappen is that the same input goes in and out of a process, but the process also \\nproduces other new data flows that are the result of manipulating the inputs.\\n2. Objects on a DFD have unique names. Every process has a unique name. There is \\nno reason for two processes to have the same name. To keep a DFD uncluttered, \\nhowever, you may repeat data stores and sources/sinks. When two arrows have \\nthe same data flow name, you must be careful that these flows are exactly the \\nsame. It is easy to reuse the same data flow name when two packets of data are \\nalmost the same but not identical. A data flow name represents a specific set of \\ndata, and another data flow that has even one more or one less piece of data \\nmust be given a different, unique name.'),\n",

Upon thinking more about the system, we saw that the \\nlarger system consisted of four processes. The act of going from a single system to \\nfour component processes is called (functional) decomposition. Functional decompo-\\nsition is an iterative process of breaking the description or perspective of a system \\ndown into finer and finer detail. This process creates a set of hierarchically related \\ncharts in which one process on a given chart is explained in greater detail on another \\nchart. For the Hoosier Burger system, we broke down, or decomposed, the larger \\nsystem into four processes. Each resulting process (or subsystem) is also a candidate \\nfor decomposition. Each process may consist of several subprocesses. Each subpro-\\ncess may also be broken down into smaller units. Decomposition continues until you \\nhave reached the point at which no subprocess can logically be broken down any \\nfurther. The lowest level of a DFD is called a primitive DFD, which we define later in \\nthis chapter.\\nLet’s continue with Hoosier Burger’s food-ordering system to see how a level-0 \\nDFD can be further decomposed. The first process in Figure 7-5, called Receive and \\nTransform Customer Food Order, transforms a customer’s verbal food order (e.g.,\\xa0“Give \\nme two cheeseburgers, one small order of fries, and one regular orange soda”) into \\nFunctional decomposition\\nAn iterative process of breaking the \\ndescription of a system down into finer and \\nfiner detail, which creates a set of charts \\nin which one process on a given chart \\nis explained in greater detail on another \\nchart.\\nHOOSIER\\nBURGER\\nTable 7-2  Rules Governing Data Flow Diagramming\\nProcess:\\nA.

A data flow has only one direction of flow between symbols. It may flow in both directions \\nbetween a process and a data store to show a read before an update. The latter is usually \\nindicated, however, by two separate arrows because these happen at different times.\\nK.   A fork in a data flow means that exactly the same data goes from a common location to \\ntwo or more different processes, data stores, or sources/sinks (this usually indicates different \\ncopies of the same data going to different locations).\\nL.   A join in a data flow means that exactly the same data come from any of two or more \\ndifferent processes, data stores, or sources/sinks to a common location.\\nM.   A data flow cannot go directly back to the same process it leaves. There must be at least one \\nother process that handles the data flow, produces some other data flow, and returns the \\noriginal data flow to the beginning process.\\nN.  A data flow to a data store means update (delete or change).\\nO.  A data flow from a data store means retrieve or use.\\nP.    A data flow has a noun phrase label.

To continue with the decomposition of Hoosier \\nBurger’s food-ordering system, we examine each of the subprocesses identified in \\nthe two level-1 diagrams we have produced, one for Process 1.0 and one for Process \\n4.0. Should we decide that any of these subprocesses should be further decomposed, \\nwe would create a level-2 diagram showing that decomposition. For example, if we \\ndecided that Process 4.3 in Figure 7-8 should be further decomposed, we would cre-\\nate a diagram that looks something like Figure 7-9. Again, notice how the subpro-\\ncesses are labeled.\\nJust as the labels for processes must follow numbering rules for clear commu-\\nnication, process names should also be clear yet concise. Typically, process names \\nbegin with an action verb, such as Receive, Calculate, Transform, Generate, or \\nProduce. Process names often are the same as the verbs used in many computer pro-\\ngramming languages. Example process names include Merge, Sort, Read, Write, and \\nPrint. Process names should capture the essential action of the process in just a few \\nwords, yet be descriptive enough of the process’s action so that anyone reading the \\nname gets a good idea of what the process does. Many times, students just learning \\nDFDs will use the names of people who perform the process or the department in \\nwhich the process is performed as the process name. This practice is not very useful \\nbecause we are more interested in the action the process represents than the person \\nperforming it or the place where it occurs.\\nBalancing dFds\\nWhen you decompose a DFD from one level to the next, there is a conservation prin-\\nciple at work. You must conserve inputs and outputs to a process at the next level of \\ndecomposition. In other words, Process 1.0, which appears in a level-0 diagram, must \\nhave the same inputs and outputs when decomposed into a level-1 diagram. This \\nconservation of inputs and outputs is called balancing.\\nLet’s look at an example of balancing a set of DFDs. Look back at Figure 7-4. \\nThis is the context diagram for Hoosier Burger’s food-ordering system. Notice that \\nthere is one input to the system, the customer order, which originates with the cus-\\ntomer. Notice also that there are three outputs: the customer receipt, the food order \\nintended for the kitchen, and management reports. Now look at Figure 7-5. This is \\nthe level-0 diagram for the food-ordering system. Remember that all data stores and \\nflows to or from them are internal to the system. Notice that the same single input \\nto the system and the same three outputs represented in the context diagram also \\nappear at level 0. Further, no new inputs to or outputs from the system have been \\nintroduced. Therefore, we can say that the context diagram and level-0 DFDs are \\nbalanced.\\nNow look at Figure 7-7, where Process 1.0 from the level-0 DFD has been de-\\ncomposed. As we have seen before, Process 1.0 has one input and four outputs. The \\nsingle input and multiple outputs all appear on the level-1 diagram in Figure 7-7. No \\nnew inputs or outputs have been added. Compare Process 4.0 in Figure 7-5 with its \\ndecomposition in Figure 7-8. You see the same conservation of inputs and outputs.\\nFigure 7-10 shows one example of what an unbalanced DFD could look like. \\nThe context diagram shows one input to the system, A, and one output, B. Yet in \\nthe level-0 diagram, there is an additional input, C, and flows A and C come from \\nBalancing\\nThe conservation of inputs and outputs \\nto a DFD process when that process is \\ndecomposed to a lower level.\\n4.3.2\\nPrint\\nManagement\\nReports\\nFormatted DataAggregated Data Management Reports\\n4.3.1\\nFormat\\nManagement\\nReports\\nFigure 7-9 \\nLevel-2 diagram showing the \\ndecomposition of Process 4.3 from the \\nlevel-1 diagram for Process 4.0 for \\nHoosier Burger’s food-ordering system'),\n",

For example, consider the partial DFDs from Hoosier Burger, illustrated in \\nFigure 7-11. In Figure 7-11a, we see that a composite, or package, data flow—Payment \\nand Coupon—is input to the process. That is, the payment and coupon always flow \\ntogether and are input to the process at the same time.

To avoid having data flow lines cross each other, you may repeat data stores or sources/ \\nsinks on a DFD.

These diagrams are still balanced because exactly the \\nsame data are included in each diagram.\\nThe principle of balancing and the goal of keeping a DFD as simple as possible \\nled to four additional, advanced rules for drawing DFDs. These advanced rules are \\nsummarized in Table 7-3. Rule Q covers the situation illustrated in Figure 7-11. Rule \\nR covers a conservation principle about process inputs and outputs. Rule S addresses \\none exception to balancing. Rule T tells you how you can minimize clutter on a DFD.\\nAn exAMPle dFd\\nTo illustrate the creation and refinement of DFDs, we will look at another example \\nfrom Hoosier Burger. We saw that the food-ordering system generates two types of \\nusage data—goods sold and inventory. At the end of each day, the manager, Bob \\nMellankamp, generates the inventory report that tells him how much inventory should \\nhave been used for each item associated with a sale. The amounts shown on the inven-\\ntory report are just one input to a largely manual inventory control system Bob uses \\nevery day. Figure 7-12 lists the steps involved in Bob’s inventory control system.\\nIn the Hoosier Burger inventory system, three sources of data come from \\noutside: suppliers, the food-ordering system inventory report, and stock on hand. \\nSuppliers provide invoices as input, and the system returns payments and orders as \\noutputs to the suppliers.

When Bob receives invoices from suppli-\\ners, he records their receipt on an invoice log sheet and files the actual invoices in \\nhis accordion file. Using the invoices, Bob records the amount of stock delivered on \\nthe stock logs, which are paper forms posted near the point of storage for each inven-\\ntory item. Figure 7-13 gives a partial example of Hoosier Burger’s stock log. Notice \\nthat the minimum order quantities—the stock level at which orders must be placed in \\norder to avoid running out of an item—appear on the log form. The stock log also has \\nspaces for entering the starting amount, amount delivered, and the amount used for \\neach item. Amounts delivered are entered on the sheet when Bob logs stock deliveries; \\namounts used are entered after Bob has compared the amounts of stock used accord-\\ning to a physical count and according to the numbers on the inventory report gener-\\nated by the food-ordering system. We should note that Hoosier Burger has standing \\ndaily delivery orders for some perishable items that are used every day, such as burger \\nbuns, meats, and vegetables. Bob uses the minimum order quantities and the amount \\nof stock on hand to determine which orders need to be placed. He uses the invoices to \\ndetermine which bills need to be paid, and he carefully records each payment.\\nTo create the DFD, we need to identify the essence of the inventory system \\nBob has established. What are the key data necessary to keep track of inventory and \\npay bills? What are the key processes involved? At least four key processes make up \\nHoosier Burger’s inventory system: (1) account for anything added to inventory, \\n(2)\\xa0account for anything taken from inventory, (3) place orders, and (4) pay bills. \\nKey data used by the system include inventories and stock-on-hand counts, however \\nthey are determined. Major outputs from the system continue to be orders and pay-\\nments. If we focus on the essential elements of the system, we obtain the context \\ndiagram and the level-0 DFD shown in Figure 7-14.\\nAt this point, we can revise the DFD based on any new functionality desired \\nfor the system. For Hoosier Burger’s inventory system, Bob Mellankamp would like \\nto add three additional functions. First, Bob would like data on new shipments to \\nbe entered into an automated system, thus doing away with paper stock log sheets. \\nBob would like shipment data to be as current as possible because it will be entered \\ninto the system as soon as the new stock arrives at the restaurant. Second, Bob would \\nlike the system to determine automatically whether a new order should be placed. \\nAutomatic ordering would relieve Bob of worrying about whether Hoosier Burger \\nhas enough of everything in stock at all times. Finally, Bob would like to be able to \\nknow, at any time, the approximate inventory level for each good in stock. For some \\ngoods, such as hamburger buns, Bob can visually inspect the amount in stock and \\ndetermine approximately how much is left and how much more is needed before \\nclosing time. For other items, however, Bob may need a rough estimate of what is in \\nstock more quickly than he can estimate via a visual inspection.\\nStock Log\\nDate: Jan 1 Jan 2\\nReorder\\nQuantity\\nStarting\\nAmount\\nAmount\\nDelivered\\nAmount\\nUsed\\nStarting\\nAmountItem\\nHamburger buns 50 dozen 55 04 31 2\\nHot dog buns 25 dozen 02 52 23\\nEnglish muﬃns 10 dozen 61 01 24\\nNapkins 2 cases 10 02 8\\nStraws 1 case 10 10\\nFigure 7-13 \\nHoosier Burger’s stock log form'),\n",

Beyond the issue of drawing \\nmechanically correct DFDs, there are other issues related to process modeling with \\nwhich you, as an analyst, must be concerned. Such issues, including whether the \\nDFDs are complete and consistent across all levels, are dealt with in the next section, \\nwhich covers guidelines for drawing DFDs. Another issue to consider is how you can \\nuse DFDs as a useful tool for analysis. In these final sections, we also illustrate how \\nDFDs can be used to support business process reengineering.\\nguidelines for drawing dFds\\nIn this section, we will consider additional guidelines for drawing DFDs that extend \\nbeyond the simple mechanics of drawing diagrams and making sure that the rules \\nlisted in Tables 7-2 and 7-3 are followed. These guidelines include (1) completeness, \\n(2) consistency, (3) timing considerations, (4) the iterative nature of drawing DFDs, \\nand (5) primitive DFDs.\\nCompleteness The concept of DFD completeness refers to whether you have in-\\ncluded in your DFDs all of the components necessary for the system you are model-\\ning. If your DFD contains data flows that do not lead anywhere or data stores, pro-\\ncesses, or external entities that are not connected to anything else, your DFD is not \\ncomplete. Most CASE tools have built-in facilities that you can run to help you de-\\ntermine if your DFD is incomplete. When you draw many DFDs for a system, it is not \\nuncommon to make errors. CASE tool analysis functions or walk-throughs with other \\nanalysts can help you identify such problems.\\nNot only must all necessary elements of a DFD be present, each of the compo-\\nnents must be fully described in the project dictionary. With most CASE tools, the \\nproject dictionary is linked with the diagram. That is, when you define a process, data \\nflow, source/sink, or data store on a DFD, an entry is automatically created in the \\nrepository for that element. You must then enter the repository and complete the el-\\nement’s description. Different descriptive information can be kept about each of the \\nfour types of elements on a DFD, and each CASE tool or project dictionary standard \\nan organization adopts has different entry information. Data flow repository entries \\ntypically include the following:\\n•\\t The label or name for the data flow as entered on the DFDs (Note: Case and \\npunctuation of the label matter, but if exactly the same label is used on multiple \\nDFDs, whether nested or not, then the same repository entry applies to each \\nreference.)\\n•\\t A short description defining the data flow\\n•\\t A list of other repository objects grouped into categories by type of object\\n•\\t The composition or list of data elements contained in the data flow\\n•\\t Notes supplementing the limited space for the description that go beyond defin-\\ning the data flow to explaining the context and nature of this repository object\\nDFD completeness\\nThe extent to which all necessary \\ncomponents of a DFD have been included \\nand fully described.'),\n",

Although very sophisticated drawing \\ntools, as well as forms and word-processing systems, exist, these stand-alone tools do \\nnot integrate graphical objects with their textual descriptions as CASE tools do.\\nConsistency The concept of DFD consistency refers to whether or not the depic-\\ntion of the system shown at one level of a nested set of DFDs is compatible with \\nthe depictions of the system shown at other levels. A gross violation of consistency \\nwould be a level-1 diagram with no level-0 diagram. Another example of inconsis-\\ntency would be a data flow that appears on a higher-level DFD but not on lower levels \\n(also a violation of balancing). Yet another example of inconsistency is a data flow \\nattached to one object on a lower-level diagram but also attached to another object \\nat a higher level; for example, a data flow named Payment, which serves as input to \\nProcess 1 on a level-0 DFD, appears as input to Process 2.1 on a level-1 diagram for \\nProcess 2.\\nCASE tools also have analysis facilities that you can use to detect such inconsis-\\ntencies across nested DFDs. For example, when you draw a DFD using a CASE tool, \\nmost tools will automatically place the inflows and outflows of a process on the DFD \\nyou create when you inform the tool to decompose that process. In manipulating \\nthe lower-level diagram, you could accidentally delete or change a data flow that \\nwould cause the diagrams to be out of balance; thus, a consistency-check facility with \\na CASE tool is quite helpful.\\nTiming You may have noticed in some of the DFD examples we have presented that \\nDFDs do not do a very good job of representing time. On a given DFD, there is no \\nindication of whether a data flow occurs constantly in real time, once per week, or \\nonce per year. There is also no indication of when a system would run. For example, \\nmany large, transaction-based systems may run several large, computing-intensive \\njobs in batch mode at night, when demands on the computer system are lighter. \\nA DFD has no way of indicating such overnight batch processing. When you draw \\nDFDs, then, draw them as if the system you are modeling has never started and will \\nnever stop.\\nIterative Development The first DFD you draw will rarely capture perfectly the sys-\\ntem you are modeling. You should count on drawing the same diagram over and \\nover again, in an iterative fashion. With each attempt, you will come closer to a good \\napproximation of the system or aspect of the system you are modeling. Iterative DFD \\ndevelopment recognizes that requirements determination and requirements struc-\\nturing are interacting, not sequential, subphases of the analysis phase of the SDLC.\\nOne rule of thumb is that it should take you about three revisions for each DFD \\nyou draw. Fortunately, CASE tools make revising drawings a lot easier than it would \\nbe if you had to draw each revision with a pencil and a template.\\nPrimitive DFDs One of the more difficult decisions you need to make when draw-\\ning DFDs is when to stop decomposing processes. One rule is to stop drawing when \\nyou have reached the lowest logical level; however, it is not always easy to know what \\nthe lowest logical level is. Other, more concrete rules for when to stop decomposing \\ninclude the following:\\n•\\t When you have reduced each process to a single decision or calculation or to a \\nsingle database operation, such as retrieve, update, create, delete, or read\\n•\\t When each data store represents data about a single entity, such as a customer, \\nemployee, product, or order\\nDFD consistency\\nThe extent to which information contained \\non one level of a set of nested DFDs is also \\nincluded on other levels.'),\n",

Seemingly \\nsimple actions, such as generating an invoice, may pull information from several en-\\ntities and may also return different results depending on the specific situation. For \\nexample, the final form of an invoice may be based on the type of customer (which \\nwould determine such things as discount rate), where the customer lives (which would \\ndetermine such things as sales tax), and how the goods are shipped (which would de-\\ntermine such things as the shipping and handling charges). At the lowest-level DFD, \\ncalled a primitive DFD, all of these conditions would have to be met. Given the amount \\nof detail called for in a primitive DFD, perhaps you can see why many experts believe \\nanalysts should not spend their time completely diagramming the current physical \\ninformation system because much of the detail will be discarded when the current \\nlogical DFD is created.\\nUsing the guidelines presented in this section will help you to create DFDs that \\nare more than just mechanically correct. Your DFDs will also be robust and accurate \\nrepresentations of the information system you are modeling. Primitive DFDs facili-\\ntate consistency checks with the documentation produced from other requirements \\nstructuring techniques and make it easy for you to transition to system design steps. \\nHaving mastered the skills of drawing good DFDs, you can now use them to support \\nthe analysis process, the subject of the next section.\\nUsing dFds as Analysis tools\\nWe have seen that DFDs are versatile tools for process modeling and that they can be \\nused to model systems that are either physical or logical, current or new. DFDs can \\nalso be used in a process called gap analysis. Analysts can use gap analysis to discover \\ndiscrepancies between two or more sets of DFDs, representing two or more states of \\nan information system, or discrepancies within a single DFD.\\nOnce the DFDs are complete, you can examine the details of individual DFDs \\nfor such problems as redundant data flows, data that are captured but are not used \\nby the system, and data that are updated identically in more than one location. These \\nproblems may not have been evident to members of the analysis team or to other \\nparticipants in the analysis process when the DFDs were created. For example, re-\\ndundant data flows may have been labeled with different names when the DFDs were \\ncreated. Now that the analysis team knows more about the system it is modeling, \\nsuch redundancies can be detected. Such redundancies can be detected most easily \\nfrom CASE tool repository reports. For example, many CASE tools can generate a \\nreport that lists all of the processes that accept a given data element as input (re-\\nmember, a list of data elements is likely part of the description of each data flow). \\nFrom the labels of these processes, you can determine whether the data are captured \\nPrimitive DFD\\nThe lowest level of decomposition for a \\nDFD.\\ngap analysis\\nThe process of discovering discrepancies \\nbetween two or more sets of DFDs or \\ndiscrepancies within a single DFD.'),\n",

In such \\ncases, the DFDs may well accurately mirror the activities occurring in the organi-\\nzation. Because the business processes being modeled took many years to develop, \\nsometimes with participants in one part of the organization adapting procedures \\nin isolation from other participants, redundancies and overlapping responsibilities \\nmay well have resulted. The careful study of the DFDs created as part of analysis \\ncan reveal these procedural redundancies and allow them to be corrected as part of \\nsystem design.\\nInefficiencies can also be identified by studying DFDs, and there are a wide va-\\nriety of inefficiencies that might exist. Some inefficiencies relate to violations of DFD \\ndrawing rules. For example, a violation of rule R from Table 7-3 could occur because \\nobsolete data are captured but never used within a system. Other inefficiencies are \\ndue to excessive processing steps. For example, consider the correct DFD in item M \\nof Figure 7-1. Although this flow is mechanically correct, such a loop may indicate \\npotential delays in processing data or unnecessary approval operations.\\nSimilarly, a set of DFDs that models the current logical system can be compared \\nwith DFDs that model the new logical system to better determine which processes \\nsystems developers need to add or revise when building the new system. Processes for \\nwhich inputs, outputs, and internal steps have not changed can possibly be reused \\nin the construction of the new system. You can compare alternative logical DFDs to \\nidentify those few elements that must be discussed in evaluating competing opinions \\non system requirements. The logical DFDs for the new system can also serve as the \\nbasis for developing alternative design strategies for the new physical system. As we \\nsaw with the Hoosier Burger example, a process on a DFD can be physically imple-\\nmented in several different ways.\\nUsing dFds in Business Process reengineering\\nDFDs are also useful for modeling processes in business process reengineering \\n(BPR), which you read about in Chapter 6. To illustrate the usefulness of DFDs for \\nBPR, let’s look at an example from Hammer and Champy (1993). Hammer and \\nChampy use IBM Credit Corporation as an example of a firm that successfully reengi-\\nneered its primary business process. IBM Credit Corporation provides financing for \\ncustomers making large purchases of IBM computer equipment. Its job is to analyze \\ndeals proposed by salespeople and write the final contracts governing those deals.\\nAccording to Hammer and Champy, IBM Credit Corporation typically took six \\nbusiness days to process each financing deal. The process worked like this: First, the \\nsalesperson called in with a proposed deal. The call was taken by one of a half dozen \\npeople sitting around a conference table. Whoever received the call logged it and \\nwrote the details on a piece of paper. A clerk then carried the paper to a second per-\\nson, who initiated the next step in the process by entering the data into a computer \\nsystem and checking the client’s creditworthiness. This person then wrote the details \\non a piece of paper and carried the paper, along with the original documentation, to \\na loan officer. Then, in a third step, the loan officer modified the standard IBM loan \\nagreement for the customer. This step involved a separate computer system from the \\none used in step two.\\nIn the fourth step, details of the modified loan agreement, along with the other \\ndocumentation, were sent on to the next station in the process, where a different \\nclerk determined the appropriate interest rate for the loan. This step also involved its \\nown information system. In step five, the resulting interest rate and all of the paper \\ngenerated up to this point were then carried to the next stop, where the quote letter \\nwas created. Once complete, the quote letter was sent via overnight mail back to the \\nsalesperson.\\nOnly reading about this process makes it seem complicated. We can use DFDs \\nto illustrate the overall process (see Figure 7-16). DFDs help us see that the process '),\n",

They took a call from a \\nsalesperson and walked it through the system. These managers found that the actual \\nwork being done on a contract only took 90 minutes. For much of the rest of the \\nsix days it took to process the deal, the various bits of documentation were sitting in \\nsomeone’s in-basket waiting to be processed.\\nIBM Credit Corporation management decided to reengineer its entire process. \\nThe five sets of task specialists were replaced with generalists. Now each call from \\nthe field goes to a single clerk, who does all the work necessary to process the con-\\ntract. Instead of having different people check for creditworthiness, modify the basic \\nloan agreement, and determine the appropriate interest rate, one person does it all. \\nIBM Credit Corporation still has specialists for the few cases that are significantly \\ndifferent from what the firm routinely encounters. In addition, the process is now \\nsupported by a single computer system. The new process is modeled by the DFD \\nin Figure 7-17. The most striking difference between the DFD in Figure 7-16 and \\nthe DFD in Figure 7-17, other than the number of process boxes in each one, is \\nRequest\\nSupporting\\nData\\nRate\\nStatus\\nSalesperson\\nProcess\\nContract\\nCredit FilesD2\\nInterest FilesD1\\nContract\\nSpecialists\\nFigure 7-17 \\nIBM Credit Corporation’s primary work \\nprocess after BPR\\n(Source: Based on Hammer and Champy, \\n1993.)\\nSalesperson\\nRequest\\nDocumentation\\nDocumentation\\nDocumentation\\nRate\\nStatus\\n2.0\\nCheck \\nCredit-\\nworthiness\\n3.0\\nModify\\nLoan \\nAgreement\\n5.0\\nCreate\\nQuote\\nLetter\\nSalesperson\\n1.0\\nLog\\nRequest\\n4.0\\nDetermine\\nInterest\\nRate\\nCredit FilesD2\\nInterest FilesD1\\nDocumentation\\nContract\\nFigure 7-16 \\nIBM Credit Corporation’s primary work \\nprocess before BPR\\n(Source: Based on Hammer and Champy, \\n1993.)'),\n",

The resulting process is much sim-\\npler and cuts down dramatically on any chance of documentation getting lost be-\\ntween steps. Redesigning the process from beginning to end allowed IBM Credit \\nCorporation to increase the number of contracts it can handle by 100-fold—not 100 \\npercent, which would only be doubling the amount of work. BPR allowed IBM Credit \\nCorporation to handle 100 times more work in the same amount of time and with \\nfewer people!\\nModeling logic with decision tABles\\nA decision table is a diagram of process logic where the logic is reasonably compli-\\ncated. All of the possible choices and the conditions the choices depend on are rep-\\nresented in tabular form, as illustrated in the decision table in Figure 7-18.\\nThe decision table in Figure 7-18 models the logic of a generic payroll system. \\nThe table has three parts: the condition stubs, the action stubs, and the rules. The \\ncondition stubs contain the various conditions that apply to the situation the table \\nis modeling. In Figure 7-18, there are two condition stubs for employee type and \\nhours worked. Employee type has two values: “S,” which stands for salaried, and “H,” \\nwhich stands for hourly. Hours worked has three values: less than 40, exactly 40, \\nand more than 40. The action stubs contain all the possible courses of action that \\nresult from combining values of the condition stubs. There are four possible courses \\nof action in this table: Pay Base Salary, Calculate Hourly Wage, Calculate Overtime, \\nand Produce Absence Report. You can see that not all actions are triggered by all \\ncombinations of conditions. Instead, specific combinations trigger specific actions. \\nThe part of the table that links conditions to actions is the section that contains \\nthe rules.\\nTo read the rules, start by reading the values of the conditions as specified in \\nthe first column: Employee type is “S,” or salaried, and hours worked is less than \\n40. When both of these conditions occur, the payroll system is to pay the base sal-\\nary. In the next column, the values are “H” and “<40,” meaning an hourly worker \\nwho worked less than 40 hours. In such a situation, the payroll system calculates \\nthe hourly wage and makes an entry in the Absence Report. Rule 3 addresses the \\n situation when a salaried employee works exactly 40 hours. The system pays the \\nbase salary, as was the case for rule 1. For an hourly worker who has worked exactly \\n40\\xa0 hours, rule 4 calculates the hourly wage. Rule 5 pays the base salary for sala-\\nried employees who work more than 40 hours. Rule 5 has the same action as rules \\n1 and 3 and governs behavior with regard to salaried employees. The number of \\nhours worked does not affect the outcome for rules 1, 3, or 5. For these rules, hours \\nworked is an indifferent condition in that its value does not affect the action taken. \\nDecision table\\nA matrix representation of the logic of a \\ndecision; it specifies the possible conditions \\nfor the decision and the resulting actions.\\nCondition stubs\\nThe part of a decision table that lists the \\nconditions relevant to the decision.\\nAction stubs\\nThe part of a decision table that lists \\nthe actions that result for a given set of \\nconditions.\\nrules\\nThe part of a decision table that specifies \\nwhich actions are to be followed for a \\ngiven set of conditions.\\nindifferent condition\\nIn a decision table, a condition whose \\nvalue does not affect which actions are \\ntaken for two or more rules.\\nConditions/ Rules\\nCourses of Action 1 34 56\\nCondition Employee type S\\n2\\nHS HS H\\nStubs Hours worked <40< 40 40 40 >40> 40\\nAction Pay base salaryX XX\\nStubs Calculate hourly wage XX X\\nXCalculate overtime\\nProduce absence reportX\\nFigure 7-18 \\nComplete decision table for payroll \\nsystem example'),\n",

Whereas we started with a deci-\\nsion table with six rules, we now have a simpler table that conveys the same informa-\\ntion with only four rules.\\nIn constructing these decision tables, we have actually followed a set of basic \\nprocedures:\\n1. Name the conditions and the values that each condition can assume. Determine all \\nof the conditions that are relevant to your problem and then determine all \\nof the values each condition can take. For some conditions, the values will \\nbe  simply “yes” or “no” (called a limited entry). For others, such as the condi-\\ntions in  Figures 7-18 and 7-19, the conditions may have more values (called an \\n extended entry).\\n2. Name all possible actions that can occur. The purpose of creating decision tables is to \\ndetermine the proper course of action given a particular set of conditions.\\n3. List all possible rules. When you first create a decision table, you have to create an \\nexhaustive set of rules. Every possible combination of conditions must be repre-\\nsented. It may turn out that some of the resulting rules are redundant or make \\nno sense, but these determinations should be made only after you have listed \\nevery rule so that no possibility is overlooked. To determine the number of rules, \\nmultiply the number of values for each condition by the number of values for ev-\\nery other condition. In Figure 7-18, we have two conditions, one with two values \\nand one with three, so we need 2 × 3, or 6, rules. If we added a third condition \\nwith three values, we would need 2 × 3 × 3, or 18, rules.\\nWhen creating the table, alternate the values for the first condition, as we \\ndid in Figure 7-18 for type of employee. For the second condition, alternate the \\nvalues but repeat the first value for all values of the first condition, then repeat \\nthe second value for all values of the first condition, and so on. You essentially \\nfollow this procedure for all subsequent conditions. Notice how we alternated \\nthe values of hours worked in Figure 7-18. We repeated “<40” for both values of \\ntype of employee, “S” and “H.” Then we repeated “40,” and then “>40.”\\n4. Define the actions for each rule. Now that all possible rules have been identified, \\nprovide an action for each rule. In our example, we were able to figure out what \\neach action should be and whether all of the actions made sense. If an action \\ndoesn’t make sense, you may want to create an “impossible” row in the action \\nstubs in the table to keep track of impossible actions. If you can’t tell what the sys-\\ntem ought to do in that situation, place question marks in the action stub spaces \\nfor that particular rule.\\nConditions/ Rules\\nCourses of Action 123 4\\nEmployee type SH HH\\nHours worked –< 40 40 >40\\nPay base salaryX\\nCalculate hourly wage XX X\\nXCalculate overtime\\nProduce absence reportX\\nFigure 7-19 \\nReduced decision table for payroll system \\nexample'),\n",

Simplify the decision table. Make the decision table as simple as possible by remov-\\ning any rules with impossible actions. Consult users on the rules where system \\nactions aren’t clear and either decide on an action or remove the rule. Look \\nfor patterns in the rules, especially for indifferent conditions. We were able to \\nreduce the number of rules in the payroll example from six to four, but greater \\nreductions are often possible.\\nLet’s look at an example from Hoosier Burger. The Mellankamps are trying \\nto determine how they reorder food and other items they use in the restaurant. If \\nthey are going to automate the inventory control functions at Hoosier Burger, they \\nneed to articulate their reordering process. In thinking through the problem, the \\nMellankamps realize that how they reorder depends on whether the item is perish-\\nable. If an item is perishable, such as meat, vegetables, or bread, the Mellankamps \\nhave a standing order with a local supplier stating that a prespecified amount of food \\nis delivered each weekday for that day’s use and each Saturday for weekend use. If \\nthe item is not perishable, such as straws, cups, and napkins, an order is placed when \\nthe stock on hand reaches a certain predetermined minimum reorder quantity. The \\nMellankamps also realize the importance of the seasonality of their work. Hoosier \\nBurger’s business is not as good during the summer months when the students are \\noff campus as it is during the academic year. They also note that business falls off \\nduring Christmas and spring break. Their standing orders with all their suppliers are \\nreduced by specific amounts during the summer and holiday breaks. Given this set of \\nconditions and actions, the Mellankamps put together an initial decision table (see \\nFigure 7-20).\\nNotice three things about Figure 7-20. First, notice how the values for the third \\ncondition have been repeated, providing a distinctive pattern for relating the values \\nfor all three conditions to each other. Every possible rule is clearly provided in this \\ntable. Second, notice that we have 12 rules. Two values for the first condition (type \\nof item) times 2 values for the second condition (time of week) times 3 values for \\nthe third condition (season of year) equals 12 possible rules. Third, notice how the \\nConditions/ Rules\\nCourses of Action 12 34 6857 91 01 11 2\\nT ype of item PP NN NNPP PP NN\\nTime of week DD DD DDWW WW WW\\nSeason of year AA AA SS SS HH HH\\nStanding daily order XX X\\nStanding weekend order XX X\\nMinimum order quantity X XXX\\nXX\\nXX\\nHoliday reduction\\nSummer reduction X X\\nT ype of item: Season of year :\\nP = perishable D = weekday\\nTime of week:\\nA = academic year\\nN = nonperishable W = weekend S = summer\\nH = holiday\\nFigure 7-20 \\nComplete decision table for Hoosier Burger’s inventory reordering\\nHOOSIER\\nBURGER'),\n",

Collapsing \\nthe decision table accordingly gives us the decision table in Figure 7-21. Now there \\nare only 7 rules instead of 12.\\nYou have now learned how to draw and simplify decision tables. You can \\nalso use decision tables to specify additional decision-related information. For ex -\\nample, if the actions that should be taken for a specific rule are more complicated \\nthan one or two lines of text can convey or if some conditions need to be checked \\nonly when other conditions are met (nested conditions), you may want to use \\nseparate, linked decision tables. In your original decision table, you can specify \\nan action in the action stub that says “Perform Table B.” Table B could contain \\nan action stub that returns to the original table, and the return would be the ac-\\ntion for one or more rules in Table B. Another way to convey more information \\nin a decision table is to use numbers that indicate sequence rather than Xs where \\nrules and action stubs intersect. For example, for rules 3 and 4 in Figure 7-21, it \\nwould be important for the Mellankamps to account for the summer reduction \\nto modify the existing standing order for supplies. “Summer reduction” would \\nbe marked with a “1” for rules 3 and 4, whereas “Standing daily order” would be \\nmarked with a “2” for rule 3, and “Standing weekend order” would be marked \\nwith a “2” for rule 4.\\nYou have seen how decision tables can model the relatively complicated logic \\nof a process. As such, decision tables are compact; you can pack a lot of information \\ninto a small table. Decision tables also allow you to check for the extent to which your \\nlogic is complete, consistent, and not redundant.\\nelectronic coMMerce APPlicAtion: Process \\nModeling Using dAtA Flow diAgrAMs\\nProcess modeling for an Internet-based electronic commerce application is no dif-\\nferent than the process followed for other applications.

His \\nfirst step was to identify the level-0—major system—processes. To begin, he care-\\nfully examined the outcomes of the JAD session that focused on defining the system \\nstructure of the WebStore system. From this analysis, he identified six high-level \\nprocesses that would become the foundation of the level-0 DFD. These processes, \\nlisted in Table 7-4, were the “work” or “action” parts of the website. Note that each \\nof these processes corresponds to the major processing items listed in the system \\nstructure.\\nNext, Jim determined that it would be most efficient if the WebStore system \\nexchanged information with existing PVF systems rather than capture and store re-\\ndundant information. This analysis concluded that the WebStore should exchange \\ninformation with the Purchasing Fulfillment System (a system for tracking orders \\n[see Chapter 3]) and the Customer Tracking System (a system for managing cus-\\ntomer information). These two existing systems will be “sources” (providers) and \\n“sinks” (receivers) of information for the WebStore system. When a customer opens \\nan account, his or her information will be passed from the WebStore system to the \\nCustomer Tracking System. When an order is placed, information will be stored in \\nthe Purchasing Fulfillment System. When a customer requests status information \\non a prior order, information will be retrieved from the Purchase Fulfillment System.\\nFinally, Jim found that the system would need to access two additional data \\nsources. First, in order to produce an online product catalog, the system would need \\nto access the inventory database. Second, to store the items a customer wanted to \\npurchase in the Webstore’s shopping cart, a temporary database would need to be \\ncreated. Once a transaction is completed, the shopping cart data can be deleted. \\nWith this information, Jim was able to develop the level-0 DFD for the Webstore sys-\\ntem, which is shown in Figure 7-22. He then felt that he had a good understanding of \\nhow information would flow through the Webstore, of how a customer would inter-\\nact with the system, and of how the Webstore would share information with existing \\nPVF systems. Each of these high-level processes would eventually need to be further \\ndecomposed before system design could proceed. Yet, before doing that, he wanted \\nto get a clear picture of exactly what data were needed throughout the entire system. \\nWe will discover the outcomes of this analysis activity—conceptual data modeling—\\nin Chapter 8.'),\n",

DFDs \\nare very useful for representing the overall data flows into, \\nthrough, and out of an information system. DFDs rely \\non four symbols to represent the four conceptual com-\\nponents of a process model: data flows, data stores, pro-\\ncesses, and sources/sinks. DFDs are hierarchical in nature, \\nand each level of a DFD can be decomposed into smaller, \\nsimpler units on a lower-level diagram. You begin process \\nmodeling by constructing a context diagram, which shows \\nthe entire system as a single process. The next step is to \\ngenerate a level-0 diagram, which shows the most impor-\\ntant high-level processes in the system. You then decom-\\npose each process in the level-0 diagram, as warranted, \\nuntil it makes no sense to go any further. When decompos-\\ning DFDs from one level to the next, it is important that \\nthe diagrams be balanced; that is, inputs and outputs on \\none level must be conserved on the next level.'),\n",

To that end, you need to check DFDs for \\ncompleteness and consistency and draw them as if the sys-\\ntem being modeled were timeless. You should be willing to \\nrevise DFDs several times. Complete sets of DFDs should \\nextend to the primitive level, where every component re-\\nflects certain irreducible properties; for example, a pro-\\ncess represents a single database operation and every data \\nstore represents data about a single entity. Following these \\nguidelines, you can produce DFDs that can be used to ana-\\nlyze the gaps between existing and desired procedures and \\nbetween current and new systems.\\nDecision tables are a graphical method of repre-\\nsenting process logic.

If the purchase \\nis under $15,000, the personal computers can simply be \\nbought from any approved vendor; however, the Purchase \\nOrder must still be approved by the Purchasing depart-\\nment. If the purchase goes out for bid, there must be at \\nleast three proposals received for the bid. If not, the RFP \\nmust go out again. If there are still not enough proposals, \\nthen the process can continue with the one or two ven-\\ndors that have submitted proposals. The winner of the bid \\nmust be on an approved list of vendors for the company \\nand must not have any violations against them for affirma-\\ntive action or environmental matters. At this point, if the \\nproposal is complete, the Purchasing department can issue \\na Purchase Order. Draw a decision table to represent the \\nlogic in this process. Notice the similarities between the \\ntext in this question and the format of your answer.\\n 7.47 In a relatively small company that sells thin, electronic key-\\npads and switches, the rules for selling products specify \\nthat sales representatives are assigned to unique regions of \\nthe country. Sales come either from cold calling, referrals, \\nor current customers with new orders. A sizable portion of \\ntheir business comes from referrals from larger competi-\\ntors who send their excess and/or “difficult” projects to \\nthis company. The company tracks these referrals and re-\\nturns the favors to these competitors by sending business \\ntheir way. The sales reps receive a 10 percent commission \\non actual purchases, not on orders, in their region. They \\ncan collaborate on a sale with reps in other regions and \\nshare the commissions, with 8 percent going to the “home” \\nrep and 2 percent going to the “visiting” rep. For any sales \\nbeyond the rep’s previously stated and approved individual \\nannual sales goals, he or she receives an additional 5 per-\\ncent commission, an additional end-of-the-year bonus de-\\ntermined by management, and a special vacation for his or \\nher family. Customers receive a 10 percent discount for any \\npurchases over $100,000 per year, which are factored into \\nthe rep’s commissions. In addition, the company focuses \\non customer satisfaction with the product and service, so \\nthere is an annual survey of customers in which they rate \\nthe sales rep. These ratings are factored into the bonuses \\nsuch that a high rating increases the bonus amount, a mod-\\nerate rating does nothing, and a low rating can lower the \\nbonus amount. The company also wants to ensure that the \\nreps close all sales. Any differences between the amount of \\norders and actual purchases are also factored into the rep’s \\nbonus amount. As best you can, present the logic of this \\nbusiness process using a decision table. Write down any as-\\nsumptions you have to make.\\n 7.48 The following is an example that demonstrates the rules of \\nthe tenure process for faculty at many universities. Present \\nthe logic of this business using a decision table. Write down \\nany assumptions you have to make.\\nA faculty member applies for tenure in his or her \\nsixth year by submitting a portfolio summarizing his \\nor her work. In rare circumstances, a faculty member \\ncan come up for tenure earlier than the sixth year, but \\nonly if the faculty member has the permission of the \\ndepartment chair and college dean. New professors \\nwho have worked at other universities before taking \\ntheir current jobs rarely, if ever, start their new jobs \\nwith tenure. They are usually asked to undergo one \\nprobationary year during which they are evaluated; \\nonly then can they be granted tenure. Top adminis-\\ntrators coming to a new university job, however, can \\noften negotiate for retreat rights that enable them \\nto become a tenured faculty member should their \\nadministrative post end. These retreat arrangements \\ngenerally have to be approved by faculty. The tenure \\nreview process begins with an evaluation of the can-\\ndidate’s portfolio by a committee of faculty within the \\ncandidate’s department. The committee then writes a \\nrecommendation on tenure and sends it to the depart-\\nment’s chairperson, who then makes a recommenda-\\ntion and passes the portfolio and recommendation to \\nthe next level, a college-wide faculty committee. This \\ncommittee does the same as the department commit-\\ntee and passes its recommendation, the department’s \\nrecommendation, and the portfolio to the next level, \\na university-wide faculty committee. This committee \\ndoes the same as the other two committees and passes \\neverything to the provost (or sometimes the academic \\nvice president). The provost then writes his or her own \\nrecommendation and passes everything to the presi-\\ndent, the final decision maker. This process, from the \\ntime the candidate creates his or her portfolio until \\nthe time the president makes a decision, can take an \\nentire academic year. The focus of the evaluation is on \\nresearch, which could be grants, presentations, and \\npublications, though preference is given for empiri-\\ncal research that has been published in top-ranked, '),\n",

The candidate must also do \\nwell in teaching and service (i.e., to the university, the \\ncommunity, or the discipline), but the primary em-\\nphasis is on research.\\n 7.49 An organization is in the process of upgrading microcom-\\nputer hardware and software for all employees. Hardware \\nwill be allocated to each employee in one of three pack-\\nages. The first hardware package includes a standard mi-\\ncrocomputer with a color monitor of moderate resolution \\nand moderate storage capabilities. The second package \\nincludes a high-end microcomputer with a high-resolution \\ncolor monitor and a great deal of RAM and ROM. The \\nthird package is a high-end notebook-sized microcom-\\nputer. Each computer comes with a network interface card \\nso that it can be connected to the network for printing and \\ne-mail. The notebook computers come with a modem for \\nthe same purpose. All new and existing employees will be \\nevaluated in terms of their computing needs (e.g., the types \\nof tasks they perform, how much and in what ways they can \\nuse the computer). Light users receive the first hardware \\npackage. Heavy users receive the second package. Some \\nmoderate users will receive the first package and some will \\nreceive the second package, depending on their needs. \\nAny employee who is deemed to be primarily mobile (e.g., \\nmost of the sales force) will receive the third package. Each \\nemployee will also be considered for additional hardware. \\nFor example, those who need scanners and/or printers \\nwill receive them. A determination will be made regard-\\ning whether the user receives a color or black-and-white \\nscanner and whether they receive a slow or fast or color \\nor black-and-white printer. In addition, each employee will \\nreceive a suite of software that includes a word processor, \\na spreadsheet, and a presentation maker. All employees \\nwill be evaluated for additional software needs. Depend-\\ning on their needs, some will receive a desktop publishing \\npackage, some will receive a database management system \\n(some will also receive a developer’s kit for the DBMS), \\nand some will receive a programming language. Every 18 \\nmonths, those employees with the high-end systems will re-\\nceive new hardware, and their old systems will be passed on \\nto those who previously had the standard systems. All those \\nemployees with the portable systems will receive new note-\\nbook computers. Present the logic of this business process \\nusing a decision table.

During this evalu-\\nation process, many factors regarding the loan request and \\nthe applicant’s background are considered.

If the credit report \\nis rated fair, the officer checks to see if the applicant has \\nan account at the bank. If the applicant holds an account, \\nthe application is approved; otherwise, the application is \\ndenied. If the credit report is rated poor, the application is \\ndenied. Loan applications for amounts between $2000 and \\n$200,000 are divided into four categories: car, mortgage, \\neducation, and other. For car, mortgage, and other loan re-\\nquests, the applicant’s credit report is reviewed and an em-\\nployment check is made to verify the applicant’s reported \\nsalary income. If the credit report rating is poor, the loan \\nis denied. If the credit report rating is fair, good, or excel-\\nlent and the salary income is verified, the loan is approved. \\nIf the salary income is not verifiable, the applicant is con-\\ntacted and additional information is requested. In this case, \\nthe loan application, along with the additional informa-\\ntion, is sent to the vice president for review and a final loan \\ndecision. For educational loans, the educational institution \\nthe applicant will attend is contacted to determine the es-\\ntimated cost of attendance. This amount is then compared \\nto the amount of the loan requested in the application. \\nIf the requested amount exceeds the cost of attendance, \\nthe loan is denied. Otherwise, education loan requests for \\namounts between $2000 and $34,999 are approved if the \\napplicant’s credit rating is fair, good, or excellent. Educa-\\ntion loan applications requesting amounts from $35,000 to \\n$200,000 are approved only if the credit rating is good or \\nexcellent. All loan applications for amounts greater than \\n$200,000 are sent to the vice president for review and ap-\\nproval. Use a decision table to represent this logic.'),\n",

Use cases are a different way to model the \\nfunctionality of a business process that facilitates the \\ndevelopment of information systems to support that \\nprocess. Although common in object-oriented sys-\\ntems analysis and design, use case modeling can also \\nbe used with more traditional methods for modeling \\nbusiness processes. After learning the basics about use \\ncases, including use case diagrams and written use cases, \\nyou will also learn how process modeling can be done \\nwith use cases for the analysis of electronic commerce \\napplications.\\nUse cAses\\nAs Chapter 7 has shown, DFDs are powerful modeling \\ntools that you can use to show a system’s functionality and \\nthe flow of data necessary for the system to perform its \\nfunctions. DFDs are not the only way to show functional-\\nity, of course. Another way is use case modeling. Use case \\nmodeling helps analysts analyze the functional require-\\nments of a system. Use case modeling helps developers \\nunderstand the functional requirements of the system \\nwithout worrying about how those requirements will be \\nIntroduction\\nimplemented. The process is inherently iterative—ana-\\nlysts and users work together throughout the model de-\\nvelopment process to further refine their use case models. \\nAlthough use case modeling is most often associated with \\nobject-oriented systems analysis and design, the concept is \\nflexible enough that it can also be used within more tradi-\\ntional approaches. In this section of the chapter, you will \\nlearn about use cases, use case diagrams and their constit-\\nuent parts, and written use cases.\\nwhat is a Use case?\\nA use case shows the behavior or functionality of a system \\n(see Figure 7-26). It consists of a set of possible sequences \\nof interactions between a system and a user in a particular \\nenvironment, possible sequences that are related to a par-\\nticular goal. A use case describes the behavior of a system \\nunder various conditions as the system responds to requests \\nfrom principal actors. A principal actor initiates a request of \\nthe system, related to a goal, and the system responds. A use \\ncase can be stated as a present-tense verb phrase, containing \\nthe verb (what the system is supposed to do) and the ob-\\nject of the verb (what the system is to act on).

An actor is an external entity \\nthat interacts with the system. It is someone or something that exchanges information \\nwith the system. For the most part, a use case represents a sequence of related actions \\ninitiated by an actor to accomplish a specific goal; it is a specific way of using the system \\n(Jacobson et al., 1992). Note that there is a difference between an actor and a user. A \\nuser is anyone who uses the system. An actor, on the other hand, represents a role that \\na user can play. The actor’s name should indicate that role. An actor is a type or class of \\nusers; a user is a specific instance of an actor class playing the actor’s role. Note that the \\nsame user can play multiple roles. For example, if William Alvarez plays two roles, one \\nas an instructor and the other as an adviser, we represent him as an instance of an actor \\ncalled Instructor and as an instance of another actor called Adviser. Because actors are \\noutside the system, you do not need to describe them in detail. The advantage of iden-\\ntifying actors is that it helps you to identify the use cases they carry out.\\nFor identifying use cases, Jacobson et al. (1992) recommend that you ask the \\nfollowing questions:\\n•\\t What are the main tasks performed by each actor?\\n•\\t Will the actor read or update any information in the system?\\n•\\t Will the actor have to inform the system about changes outside the system?\\n•\\t Does the actor have to be informed of unexpected changes?\\nUse case diagrams\\nUse cases help you capture the functional requirements of a system. As you saw in \\nChapter 6, during the requirements analysis stage, the analyst sits down with the in-\\ntended users of a system and makes a thorough analysis of what functions they desire \\nfrom the system. When it comes time to structure these requirements, the identified \\nsystem functions are represented as use cases. For example, a university registration \\nsystem has a use case for class registration and another for student billing. These use \\ncases, then, represent the typical interactions the system has with its users.\\nA use case diagram is depicted diagrammatically, as in Figure 7-26. It is a picture \\nthat shows system behavior, along with the key actors that interact with the system. The \\nuse case diagram in Figure 7-26 is for a university registration system, which is shown \\nuse case\\nA depiction of a system’s behavior or \\nfunctionality under various conditions as the \\nsystem responds to requests from users.\\nActor\\nAn external entity that interacts with a \\nsystem.\\nuse case diagram\\nA picture showing system behavior, along \\nwith the key actors that interact with the \\nsystem.\\nStudent Registration\\nClerk\\nBursar’s\\nOﬃce\\nInstructor\\nRegister for\\nClasses\\nIdentify Prerequisite\\nCourses Not Completed\\n<<extend>>\\n<<extend>>\\nRegister for\\nSpecial Class\\nBill Student\\nFigure 7-26 \\nA use case diagram for a university \\nregistration system'),\n",

Outside the box are four actors—Student, Registration Clerk, Instructor, \\nand Bursar’s Office—that interact with the system. An actor is shown using a stick-\\nfigure symbol with its name below it. Inside the box are four use cases—Register for \\nClasses, Register for Special Class, Identify Prereq Courses Not Completed, and Bill \\nStudent—which are shown as ellipses with their names underneath. These use cases \\nare performed by the actors outside the system.\\nTypically, a use case is initiated by an actor. For example, Bill Student is initiated \\nby the Bursar’s Office. A use case can interact with actors other than the one that \\ninitiated it. The Bill Student use case, although initiated by the Bursar’s Office, inter-\\nacts with the Students by mailing them tuition invoices. Another use case, Register \\nfor Classes, is carried out by two actors, Student and Registration Clerk. This use \\ncase performs a series of related actions aimed at registering a student for a class. \\nAlthough use cases are typically initiated by actors, in some circumstances a use case \\nis initiated by another use case. Such use cases are called abstract use cases. We will \\ndiscuss these in more detail later in this appendix.\\nA use case represents complete functionality. You should not represent an indi-\\nvidual action that is part of an overall function as a use case. For example, although \\nsubmitting a registration form and paying tuition are two actions performed by users \\n(students) in the university registration system, we do not show them as use cases \\nbecause they do not specify a complete course of events; each of these actions is \\nexecuted only as part of an overall function or use case. You can think of Submit \\nRegistration Form as one of the actions of the Register for Classes use case and of Pay \\nTuition as one of the actions of the Bill Student use case.\\ndefinitions and symbols\\nUse case diagramming is relatively simple because it involves only a few symbols. \\nHowever, like DFDs and other relatively simple diagramming tools, these few sym-\\nbols can be used to represent quite complex situations. Mastering use case diagram-\\nming takes a lot of practice. The key symbols in a use case diagram are illustrated in \\nFigure\\xa07-26 and explained below:\\n•\\t Actor. As explained earlier, an actor is a role, not an individual. Individuals are \\ninstances of actors. One particular individual may play many roles simultane-\\nously. An actor is involved with the functioning of a system at some basic level. \\nActors are represented by stick figures.\\n•\\t Use case. Each use case is represented as an ellipse. Each use case represents a \\nsingle system function. The name of the use case can be listed inside the ellipse \\nor just below it.\\n•\\t System boundary. The system boundary is represented as a box that includes all of \\nthe relevant use cases. Note that actors are outside the system boundary.\\n•\\t Connections. In Figure 7-26, note that the actors are connected to use cases \\nwith lines, and that use cases are connected to each other with arrows. A \\nsolid line connecting an actor to a use case shows that the actor is involved in \\nthat particular system function. The solid line does not mean that the actor \\nis sending data to or receiving data from the use case. Note that all of the \\nactors in a use case diagram are not involved in all the use cases in the system. \\nThe dotted-line arrows that connect use cases also have labels (there is an \\n<<extend>> label on the arrows in Figure 7-26). These use case connections and \\ntheir labels are explained next. Note that use cases do not have to be connected \\nto other use cases. The arrows between use cases do not illustrate data or \\nprocess flows.\\n•\\t Extend relationship. An extend relationship extends a use case by adding new \\nbehaviors or actions. It is shown as a dotted-line arrow pointing toward the use \\ncase that has been extended and labeled with the <<extend>> symbol. The \\nextend relationship\\nAn association between two use cases \\nwhere one adds new behaviors or actions \\nto the other.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\ASUS\\\\Desktop\\\\AI powered chatbot\\\\Data\\\\SAD.pdf', 'page': 244}, page_content='220 part iii   AnAlySiS\\ndotted-line arrow does not indicate any kind of data or process flow between use \\ncases. In Figure 7-26, for example, the Register for Special Class use case extends \\nthe Register for Classes use case by capturing the additional actions that need \\nto be performed in registering a student for a special class. Registering for a \\nspecial class requires prior permission of the instructor, in addition to the other \\nsteps carried out for a regular registration. You may think of Register for Classes \\nas the basic course, which is always performed—independent of whether the \\nextension is performed or not—and Register for Special Class as an alternative \\ncourse, which is performed only under special circumstances.\\nNote also that the Instructor actor is needed for Register for Special Class. The \\nInstructor is not needed for Register for Classes, which involves the Student and \\nRegistration Clerk actors only. The reason for not including the Instructor for nor-\\nmal registration but including him or her for registering for special classes is that \\ncertain additional actions are required from the Instructor for a special class. The \\nInstructor’s approval is likely needed just to create an instance of a special class, and \\nthere may be other special requirements that need to be met for the class to be cre-\\nated. None of these special arrangements are necessary for normal registration, so \\nthe Instructor is not needed under normal circumstances.\\nAnother example of an extend relationship is that between the Identify Prereq \\nCourses Not Completed and Register for Classes use cases. The former extends the \\nlatter in situations where a student registering for a class has not taken the prerequi-\\nsite courses.\\n•\\t Include relationship. Another kind of relationship between use cases is an include \\nrelationship, which arises when one use case uses another use case. An include \\nrelationship is shown diagrammatically as a dotted-line arrow pointed toward the \\nuse case that is being used. The line is labeled with the <<include>> symbol.  \\nThe dotted-line arrow does not indicate any kind of data or process flow \\nbetween use cases. An include relationship implies that the use case where the \\narrow originates uses the use case where the arrow ends while it is executing. \\nTypically, the use case that is “included” represents a generic function that is \\ncommon to many business functions. Rather than reproduce that functionality \\nwithin every use case that needs it, the functionality is factored out into a sepa-\\nrate use case that can then be used by other use cases. An example of an include \\nrelationship is shown in Figure 7-27.\\nFigure 7-27 shows a generic use case diagram for any business that needs to \\nreorder supplies on a regular basis, such as a retail establishment or a restaurant. \\nBecause this is a generic use case diagram, its use cases are high level. Three differ-\\nent use cases are identified in the figure: Reorder Supplies, Produce Management \\ninclude relationship\\nAn association between two use cases \\nwhere one use case uses the functionality \\ncontained in the other.\\n<<include>>\\n<<include>>\\nSupplier\\nManager\\nReorder\\nSupplies\\nProduce\\nManagement\\nReports\\nTrack Sales and\\nInventory Data\\nFigure 7-27 \\nA use case diagram featuring an include \\nrelationship'),\n",

Two actors have been identified: \\nSupplier and Manager. Reorder Supplies involves the Manager and Supplier actors. \\nA manager initiates the use case, which then sends requests to suppliers for various \\nitems. The Produce Management Reports use case involves only the Manager actor. \\nIn Figure 7-27, the include relationship between the Reorder Supplies and Track \\nSales and Inventory Data use cases implies that the former uses the latter while ex-\\necuting. Simply put, when a manager reorders supplies, the sales and inventory data \\nare tracked. The same data are also tracked when management reports are produced, \\nso there is another include relationship between the Produce Management Reports \\nand Track Sales and Inventory Data use cases.\\nThe Track Sales and Inventory Data is a generalized use case, representing the \\ncommon behavior among the specialized use cases Reorder Supplies and Produce \\nManagement Reports. When Reorder Supplies or Produce Management Reports is \\nperformed, the entire Track Sales and Inventory Data use case is used. Note, however, \\nthat it is used only when one of the specialized use cases is performed. Such a use \\ncase, which is never performed by itself, is called an abstract use case (Eriksson and \\nPenker, 1998; Jacobson et al., 1992). An abstract case does not interact directly with \\nan actor.\\nFigure 7-28 shows a use case diagram for Hoosier Burger. Several actors and \\nuse cases can be identified. The actor that first comes to mind is Customer, which \\nrepresents the class of all customers who order food at Hoosier Burger; Order food \\nis therefore represented as a use case. The other actor that is involved in this use \\ncase is Service Person. A specific scenario would represent a customer (an instance \\nof Customer) placing an order with a service person (an instance of Service Person). \\nAt the end of each day, the manager of Hoosier Burger reorders supplies by calling \\nsuppliers. We represent this by a use case called Reorder Supplies, which involves \\nthe Manager and Supplier actors. A manager initiates the use case, which then sends \\nrequests to suppliers for various items.\\nCustomer Service\\nPerson\\nApplicant\\nSupplier\\nManager\\nOrder Food\\nHire Employee\\nReorder\\nSupplies\\nTrack Sales and\\nInventory Data\\nProduce Management\\nReports\\n<<include>>\\n<<include>>\\nFigure 7-28 \\nUse case diagram for Hoosier Burger'),\n",

Therefore, we have \\nidentified a use case, called Hire employee, in which two actors, Manager and \\nApplicant, are involved. When a person applies for a job at Hoosier Burger, the man-\\nager makes a hiring decision.\\nFigure 7-28 provides another example of an include relationship, shown dia-\\ngrammatically as a dashed line pointing toward the use case that is being used; the \\nline is labeled with the <<include>> symbol. In Figure 7-28, for example, the include \\nrelationship between the Reorder Supplies and Track Sales and Inventory Data use \\ncases implies that the former uses the latter while executing. When a manager re-\\norders supplies, the sales and inventory data are tracked. The same data are also \\ntracked when management reports are produced, so there is another include rela-\\ntionship between the Produce Management Reports and Track Sales and Inventory \\nData use cases.\\nTrack Sales and Inventory Data is a generalized use case, representing the \\ncommon behavior among the specialized use cases Reorder Supplies and Produce \\nManagement Reports. When a task like Reorder Supplies or Produce Management \\nReports is performed, the entire Track Sales and Inventory Data case is used. Note, \\nhowever, that it is used only when one of the specialized use cases is performed. As \\nyou will recall, such a use case, which is never performed by itself, is called an abstract \\nuse case (Eriksson and Penker, 1998; Jacobson et al., 1992).\\nwritten Use cAses\\nUse case diagrams can represent the functionality of a system by showing use case \\nnames and the actors who are involved with them. The names of the use cases alone \\ndo not provide much of the information that is necessary to continue with analysis \\nand to move on to the design phase. We also need to know what goes on inside each \\nuse case. The contents of a use case can be written in simple text, as was explained \\nbefore for the Register for Classes use case in Figure 7-26. Others recommend tem-\\nplates that force consideration of all of the important information one needs to have \\nabout use cases.\\nCockburn (2001) recommends a specific template for writing use cases \\n(Figure\\xa07-29). Templates can be simpler than the one Cockburn recommends or \\nmore complicated. The point is not the format of the template so much as it is \\nhow the template encourages analysts to write complete use cases. Each heading \\nreminds the analyst of the information that needs to be provided. In the template \\nin Figure 7-29, it should be clear what information is being sought.

The other \\ninformation asked for in the template is new and will be discussed in more detail. \\nThe next section will deal exclusively with an important concept, the level of the use \\ncase. The following section will deal with the rest of the terms in the template.\\nlevel\\nLevel has to do with the level of detail at which the use case is being described. Level \\ncan range from high to low, where high is general and abstract, and low is detailed. \\nCockburn suggests five different levels of detail:\\n•\\t White: As seen from the clouds, as if flying in a plane at 35,000 feet.\\n•\\t Kite: You’re still in the air, but more detail than at cloud level.\\n•\\t Blue: Also known as sea level.\\n•\\t Fish: This is below sea level with a lot of detail. The detail increases deeper \\ndown, just like air pressure.\\n•\\t Black: This is the bottom of the sea where the maximum amount of detail is \\nprovided.\\nBoth the white and kite levels provide a summary of the use case goals. These \\ngoals are at a very high level. Goals at the white level are enterprise-wide, whereas at the \\nkite level, the goals are those of a single business unit. Use cases at the white and kite \\nlevels are sometimes called summary use cases. Summary use cases do not include func-\\ntional requirements. Use cases written at the blue level, or sea level, focus on user goals: \\nWhat is the user trying to achieve in interacting with the system? Use cases written at \\nthe fish and black levels (sometimes called the clam level) are much more detailed and \\nfocus on subfunction goals. To see how the levels relate to each other, think about the \\nview of the Caribbean Sea you would get if you were flying over it in a big plane like a \\n757. You can’t see the bottom of the sea, and at this altitude, you can’t even see much \\ndetail about the surface of the water. This would be the white level. Then think about \\nhow the same stretch of the Caribbean would look from about 100 feet up. This is the \\nkite level. From the kite level, you would be able to see a lot more detail on the surface, \\ncompared to being in the 757 jet, but you still can’t see a lot of detail on the sea bottom, \\neven with the water as clear as it is in a lot of the Caribbean. Now imagine the view of \\nthe same place from a rowboat. This is the user goal or sea level view. You can see the \\nbottom much more clearly now, but it’s still not completely clear. Now dive under the \\nwater and go down about 50 feet. You are a lot closer to the bottom—the fish level—\\nand so now you can see a lot more detail at the bottom of the sea. But you don’t see the \\nmost detail possible until you are sitting on the bottom itself—the black or clam level.\\nTo put all this into a business function perspective, let’s imagine five levels of \\nuse cases written for the Ford Motor Company. The white level use cases would serve \\nan enterprise-wide goal (“Buy parts to build cars”), whereas a kite level use case \\nwould serve one business unit (“Buy parts to build Escorts”). If a system user has the \\nrole of procurement manager for the Escort model, the user goals at sea level might \\nbe “Order Escort parts from suppliers” and “Pay bills.” A fish level goal for the pro-\\ncurement system might include “Choose supplier for a part.” A black or clam level \\ngoal for the same system might include “Establish a secure connection.” Figure 7-30 \\nshows the relationships among the levels.\\nthe rest of the template\\nNext in the use case template is the list of stakeholders: those people who have some \\nkey interest in the development of the system. They would include the system’s users \\nas well as the manager, other managers in the company, customers, stockholders, the \\nvendors that supply the company, and so on. Stakeholders are important to identify \\nLevel\\nPerspective from which a use case \\ndescription is written, typically ranging from \\nhigh level to extremely detailed.\\nStakeholder\\nPeople who have a vested interest in the \\nsystem being developed.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\ASUS\\\\Desktop\\\\AI powered chatbot\\\\Data\\\\SAD.pdf', 'page': 248}, page_content='224 part iii   AnAlySiS\\nbecause they typically have some impact on what the system does and on how it is \\ndesigned. It should be obvious that some stakeholders have more of a stake than oth-\\ners, and the most involved stakeholders are the ones that probably should be listened \\nto first.\\nThe next term in Cockburn’s template (Figure 7-29) is preconditions, which \\nare those things the system must ensure are true before the use case can start. For \\nexample, in Figure 7-26, for the use case Register for Classes, students would not \\nbe allowed to register if they had any outstanding debts due to the university. No \\noutstanding debts would be listed under preconditions for Register for Classes in its \\nwritten use case template.\\nNext is minimal guarantee. According to Cockburn, the minimal guarantee is \\nthe least amount promised by the use case to the stakeholder. One way to determine \\nwhat this should be is to ask, “What would make the stakeholder unhappy?” For \\nsome use cases, the minimal guarantee might be simply that nothing happens. The \\nstakeholder would be unhappy because the system does not do what it is supposed \\nto. However, no detrimental effects result either; no bad data are entered into the \\nsystem, no data are lost, and the system does not crash. For many use cases, the best \\nthing to offer for a minimal guarantee is to roll back the transaction to its original \\nstarting place; nothing is gained but no harm is done either.\\nA success guarantee lists what it takes to satisfy stakeholders if the use case is \\ncompleted successfully. For example, in Figure 7-26, for the use case Bill Student, a \\nsuccess guarantee would involve the successful compilation of charges due from the \\nstudent and the successful creation of an accurate invoice that reflects those charges. \\nThis does not imply that the student is happy with the result; he or she might think \\nthe charges are too high or too low (although rarely the latter). What is important is \\nthat the use case functioned correctly and achieved its goals.\\nNext is the slot in the template for trigger, the thing that initiates the use case. \\nA trigger could be a phone call, a letter, or even a call from another use case. In the \\nexample of Bill Student, the trigger could be a message indicating that the class reg-\\nistration process was complete.\\nThe last item in Cockburn’s written use case template is extensions. Maybe the \\nbest way to think about an extension is as the “else statement” that follows an “if \\nstatement.” An extension is invoked only if its associated condition is encountered. \\nIn a written use case, the conditions that invoke extensions usually refer to some \\ntype of system failure. For example, if a use case involves access through the Internet \\nand a network failure occurs so that the Internet connection is lost, what happens? \\nIf the system requires a log-in and the user provides the wrong account name, what \\nhappens? If the user provides the wrong password, what happens? All of the ac-\\ntions that would follow these conditions would be listed in the use case template as \\nextensions.\\nPreconditions\\nThings that must be true before a use case \\ncan start.\\nMinimal guarantee\\nThe least amount promised to the \\nstakeholder by a use case.\\nSuccess guarantee\\nWhat a use case must do effectively in \\norder to satisfy stakeholders.\\nTrigger\\nEvent that initiates a use case.\\nextension\\nThe set of behaviors or functions in a use \\ncase that follow exceptions to the main \\nsuccess scenario.\\nBuy parts to build cars\\nBuy parts to build Escorts\\nOrder Escort parts from suppliers\\nChoose supplier for part\\nEncrypt data for secure transmission\\nFigure 7-30 \\nUse case levels and detail when moving \\nfrom top to bottom\\n(Source: George, Joey F.; Batra, Dinesh; \\nValacich, Joseph S.; Hoffer, Jeffrey A., \\nObject-Oriented Systems Analysis and Design, \\n2nd Ed., ©2007, pp. 174, 168, 175, 172, \\n176, 177.

A registration form will then open, which \\nthe user must complete. The system then checks to see if the form has been com-\\npleted correctly. If so, the action proceeds to the merge point. If not, the user must \\ncomplete the registration form again. Once the user has successfully logged in, the \\nflow of the action moves to the end of the activity diagram. In practice, this activity \\ndiagram would illustrate only one small part of a larger process involving a system. \\nThere would typically be activities before the log-in branch, and there would be other \\nactivities following the merge at the bottom of the diagram.\\nAnother simple activity diagram is shown in Figure\\xa0 7-38. This activity diagram \\nshows how you might order a pizza. The process starts with the first activity, browsing \\nthe menu of your favorite pizza restaurant or take-out place. The next step is to call \\nand order the pizza. The third step is to take delivery. But if the pizza is not what you \\nordered, you don’t want it. So there is a conditional branch included.

Note how both of the activities that follow the branch lead to the end of the \\nactivity diagram.\\nBoth of the activity diagrams you have seen so far have been relatively simple \\nand have involved only one participant.

An activity diagram can be used to show the logic of a use case.\\nwhen to Use An ActiVity diAgrAM\\nAn activity diagram is a flexible tool that can be used in a variety of situations. It can \\nbe used at a high level as well as at a low level of abstraction. It should be used only \\nwhen it adds value to the project. Our recommendation is to use it sparingly. Ask the \\nfollowing question: Does it add value or is it redundant? Specifically, an activity dia-\\ngram can be used to accomplish the following tasks:\\n1. Depict the flow of control from activity to activity.\\n2. Help in use case analysis to understand what actions need to take place.\\n3. Help in identifying extensions in a use case.\\n4. Model work flow and business processes.\\n5. Model the sequential and concurrent steps in a computation process.\\nThe interpretation of the term activity depends on the perspective from which \\none is drawing the diagram. At a conceptual level, an activity is a task that needs to be \\ndone, whether by a human or a computer (Fowler and Scott, 1999). At an implemen-\\ntation level, an activity is a method or a class.\\nProblemS and exercISeS\\n 7B.1 Draw an activity diagram that models the following em-\\nployee reimbursement process.\\nEmployees of West Nile Valley University have to fol-\\nlow a specific procedure to get reimbursed for travel \\nthey undertake on behalf of the university.

As part of its \\noperations, Maximum provides a 1-800 telephone \\nnumber help desk for clients with questions about soft-\\nware purchased from Maximum. When a call comes \\nin, an operator inquires about the nature of the call. \\nFor calls that are not truly help desk functions, the op-\\nerator redirects the call to another unit of the com-\\npany (such as order processing or billing). Because \\nmany customer questions require in-depth knowledge \\nof a product, help desk consultants are organized by \\nproduct. The operator directs the call to a consultant \\nskilled on the software that the caller needs help with. \\nBecause a consultant is not always immediately avail-\\nable, some calls must be put into a queue for the next \\navailable consultant.\\nOnce a consultant answers the call, he or she \\ndetermines whether this is the first call from this cus-\\ntomer about this problem. If so, a new call report is \\ncreated to keep track of all information about the \\nproblem. If not, the customer is asked for a call report \\nnumber so the consultant can retrieve the open call re-\\nport to determine the status of the inquiry. If the caller \\ndoes not know the call report number, the consultant \\ncollects other identifying information such as the call-\\ner’s name, the software involved, or the name of the \\nconsultant who has handled the previous calls on the \\nproblem in order to conduct a search for the appropri-\\nate call report. If a resolution of the customer’s prob-\\nlem has been found, the consultant informs the client \\nwhat that resolution is, indicates on the report that the \\ncustomer has been notified, and closes out the report. \\nIf a resolution has not been discovered, the consultant \\nfinds out whether the consultant previously handling \\nthis problem is on duty. If so, the call is transferred to \\nthe other consultant (or the call is put into the queue \\nof calls waiting to be handled by that consultant).\\nOnce the proper consultant receives the call, any \\nnew details the customer may have are recorded. For \\ncontinuing problems and for new call reports, the \\nconsultant tries to discover an answer to the problem \\nby using the relevant software and looking up infor-\\nmation in reference manuals. If the problem can be \\nresolved, the customer is told how to deal with the \\nproblem, and the call report is closed. Otherwise, the \\nconsultant files the report for continued research and \\ntells the customer that someone at Maximum will be \\nin touch, or if the customer discovers new information \\nabout the problem, he or she can call back, identifying \\nthe problem with a specified call report number.\\nreFerence\\nFowler, M., and K.

The generic form \\nshows all possible sequences of interactions, that is, the se-\\nquences corresponding to all the scenarios of a use case. \\nFor example, a generic sequence diagram for the Class \\nregistration use case (see Figure 7-26) would capture the \\nsequence of interactions for every valid scenario of that \\nuse case. The instance form, on the other hand, shows \\nthe sequence for only one scenario. A scenario in UML \\nrefers to a single path, among many possible different \\npaths, through a use case (Fowler, 2003). A path repre-\\nsents a specific combination of conditions within the use \\ncase. In Figure 7-40, a sequence diagram is shown, in in-\\nstance form, for a scenario in which a student registers for \\na course that specifies one or more prerequisite courses as \\nrequirements.\\nThe vertical axis of the diagram represents time, and \\nthe horizontal axis represents the various participating ob-\\njects. Time increases as we go down the vertical axis. The \\ndiagram has six objects, from an instance of Registration \\nWindow on the left to an instance of Registration called \\n“a New Registration” on the right. The ordering of the \\nobjects has no significance. However, you should try to ar-\\nrange the objects so that the diagram is easy to read and \\nunderstand. Each object is shown as a vertical dashed line \\ncalled the lifeline; the lifeline represents the object’s exis-\\ntence over a certain period of time. An object symbol—a \\nbox with the object’s name underlined—is placed at the \\nhead of each lifeline.\\nIn this section on object-oriented analysis and design, \\nwe will introduce you to sequence diagrams. We will first \\nshow how to design some of the use cases we identified \\nearlier in the analysis phase (Chapter 7) using sequence \\ndiagrams. A use case design describes how each use case is \\nperformed by a set of communicating objects (Jacobson \\net al., 1992). In UML, an interaction diagram is used to \\nshow the pattern of interactions among objects for a par-\\nticular use case. There are two types of interaction dia-\\ngrams: sequence diagrams and collaboration diagrams \\n(Object Management Group, 2008). Both express similar \\ninformation, but they do so in different ways. Whereas \\nsequence diagrams show the explicit sequencing of mes-\\nsages, collaboration diagrams show the relationships \\namong objects. In the next section, we will show you how \\nto design use cases using sequence diagrams.\\ndynAMic Modeling: seqUence \\ndiAgrAMs\\nA sequence diagram depicts the interactions among objects \\nduring a certain period of time. Because the pattern of inter-\\nactions varies from one use case to another, each sequence \\ndiagram shows only the interactions pertinent to a specific \\nuse case. It shows the participating objects by their lifelines \\nand the interactions among those objects—arranged in time \\nsequence—by the messages they exchange with one another.\\nobject-oriented Analysis \\nand design\\nsequence diagrams*7C \\nAppendix\\n* The original version of this appendix was written by Professor Atish P.

An activation shows the time period during which an object per -\\nforms an operation, either directly or through a call to some subordinate operation. \\nThe top of the rectangle, which is at the tip of an incoming message, indicates the \\ninitiation of the activation; the bottom indicates its completion.\\nObjects communicate with one another by sending messages. A message is \\nshown as a solid arrow from the sending object to the receiving object. For example, \\nthe checkIfOpen message is represented by an arrow from the Registration Entry ob-\\nject to the Course Offering object. When the arrow points directly into an object box, \\na new instance of that object is created. Normally the arrow is drawn horizontally, but \\nin some situations (discussed later), you may have to draw a sloping message line.\\nMessages can be of different types (Object Management Group, 2008). Each \\ntype is indicated in a diagram by a particular type of arrowhead. A synchronous mes-\\nsage, shown as a full, solid arrowhead, is one where the caller has to wait for the \\nreceiving object to complete execution of the called operation before it itself can \\nresume execution. An example of a synchronous message is checkIfOpen. When a \\nRegistration Entry object sends this message to a Course Offering object, the latter re-\\nsponds by executing an operation called checkIfOpen (same name as the message). \\nAfter the execution of this operation is complete, control is transferred back to the \\ncalling operation within Registration Entry with a return value of “true” or “false.”\\nSequence diagram\\nDepicts the interactions among objects \\nduring a certain period of time.\\nActivation\\nThe time period during which an object \\nperforms an operation.\\nSynchronous message\\nA type of message in which the caller has \\nto wait for the receiving object to finish \\nexecuting the called operation before it can \\nresume execution itself.\\n:Course\\nOﬀering :Course :Student\\nopen ( )\\nenterClass\\n(stud, \\nclass)\\nConﬁrmed\\nRegistration\\n:Registration\\nWindow\\na New Registration\\n:Registration\\ncheckIfOpen ( )\\n:Registration\\nEntry\\nPrereqs\\n[existsPrereqs=“true”] checkPrereqs (prereqs)\\n[checkPrereqs=“true”] new ( )\\nincrementClassSize ( )\\n[isClassFull=“false”]\\nisClassFull ( )\\n[checkIfOpen=“true”]  \\nexistsPrereqs ( )\\nFigure 7-40 \\nSequence diagram for a class registration \\nscenario with prerequisites'),\n",

The message \\nmay provide the caller with some return value(s) or simply acknowledge to the caller \\nthat the operation called has been successfully completed. We have not shown the \\nreturn for the checkIfOpen message; it is implicit. We have explicitly shown the re-\\nturn for the existsPrereqs message from Registration Entry to Course. The tail of the \\nreturn message is aligned with the base of the activation rectangle for the existsPre-\\nreqs operation. The message returns the list of prerequisites, if any, for the course in \\nquestion. Return messages, if shown, unnecessarily clutter the diagram; you can show \\nonly the ones that help in understanding the sequence of interactions.\\nA simple message simply transfers control from the sender to the recipi-\\nent without describing the details of the communication. In a diagram, the ar -\\nrowhead for a simple message is drawn as a transverse tick mark. As we have seen, \\nthe return of a synchronous message is a simple message. The “open” message in \\nFigure 7-40 is also a simple message; it simply transfers control to the Registration \\nWindow object.\\nAn asynchronous message, shown as a half arrowhead in a sequence diagram, \\nis one where the sender does not have to wait for the recipient to handle the mes-\\nsage. The sender can continue executing immediately after sending the message. \\nAsynchronous messages are common in concurrent, real-time systems, in which sev-\\neral objects operate in parallel. We do not discuss asynchronous messages further in \\nAppendix 7C.\\ndesigning A Use cAse with A seqUence \\ndiAgrAM\\nLet us now see how we can design use cases. We will draw a sequence diagram for an \\ninstance of the Class registration use case, one in which the course has prerequisites. \\nA description of this scenario is provided below.\\n1. Registration Clerk opens the registration window and enters the registration in-\\nformation (student and class).\\n2. Check if the class is open.\\n3. If the class is open, check if the course has any prerequisites.\\n4. If the course has prerequisites, then check if the student has taken all of those \\nprerequisites.\\n5. If the student has taken those prerequisites, then register the student for the \\nclass and increment the class size by one.\\n6. Check if the class is full; if not, do nothing.\\n7. Display the confirmed registration in the registration window.\\nThe diagram of Figure 7-40 shows the sequence of interactions for this sce-\\nnario. In response to the “open” message from Registration Clerk (external actor), \\nthe registration window pops up on the screen and the registration information is en-\\ntered. This creates a new Registration Entry object, which then sends a checkIfOpen \\nmessage to the Course Offering object (representing the class the student wants to \\nregister for). There are two possible return values: “true” or “false.” In this scenario, \\nthe assumption is that the class is open. We have therefore placed a guard condition, \\ncheckIfOpen =“true,” on the message existsPrereqs. The guard condition ensures \\nthat the message will be sent only if the class is open. The return value is a list of pre-\\nrequisites; the return is shown explicitly in the diagram.\\nFor this scenario, the fact that the course has prerequisites is captured by the \\nguard condition existsPrereqs = “true.” If this condition is satisfied, the Registration \\nEntry object sends a checkPrereqs message, with “prereqs” as an argument, to the \\nStudent object to determine if the student has taken those prerequisites. If the stu-\\ndent has taken all the prerequisites, the Registration Entry object creates an object \\ncalled “a New Registration,” which denotes a new registration.\\nSimple message\\nA message that transfers control from the \\nsender to the recipient without describing \\nthe details of the communication.\\nAsynchronous message\\nA message in which the sender does not \\nhave to wait for the recipient to handle the \\nmessage.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\ASUS\\\\Desktop\\\\AI powered chatbot\\\\Data\\\\SAD.pdf', 'page': 264}, page_content='240 part iii   AnAlySiS\\nNext, “a New Registration” sends a message called incrementClassSize to \\nCourse Offering in order to increase the class size by one. The incrementClassSize \\noperation within Course Offering then calls upon isClassFull, another operation \\nwithin the same object; this is known as self-delegation (Fowler, 2003). Assuming that \\nthe class is not full, the isClassFull operation returns control to the calling operation \\nwith a value of “false.” Next, the incrementClassSize operation completes and relin-\\nquishes control to the calling operation within “a New Registration.”\\nFinally, on receipt of the return message from “a New Registration,” the \\nRegistration Entry object destroys itself (the destruction is shown with a large X) \\nand sends a confirmation of the registration to the registration window. Note that \\nRegistration Entry is not a persistent object; it is created on the fly to control the \\nsequence of interactions and is deleted as soon as the registration is completed. In \\nbetween, it calls several other operations within other objects by sequencing the \\nfollowing messages: checkIfOpen, existsPrereqs, checkPrereqs, and new. Hence, \\nRegistration Entry may be viewed as a control object (Jacobson et al., 1992).\\nApart from the Registration Entry object, “a New Registration” is also created dur-\\ning the time period captured in the diagram. The messages that created these objects \\nare represented by arrows pointing directly toward the object symbols. For example, \\nthe arrow representing the message called “new” is connected to the object symbol for \\n“a New Registration.” The lifeline of such an object begins when the message that cre-\\nates it is received (the dashed vertical line is hidden behind the activation rectangle).\\nAs we discussed before, the Registration Entry object is destroyed at the point \\nmarked by X. The lifeline of this object, therefore, extends from the point of creation \\nto the point of destruction. For objects that are neither created nor destroyed during \\nthe time period captured in the diagram—for example, Course Offering, Course, \\nand Student—the lifelines extend from the top to the bottom of the diagram.\\nFigure 7-41 shows the sequence diagram for a slightly different scenario—when \\na student registers for a course without any prerequisites. Notice that the guard con-\\ndition to be satisfied for creating “a New Registration,” existsPrereqs =“false,” is dif-\\nferent from that in the previous scenario. Also, because there is no need to check if \\nthe student has taken the prerequisites, there is no need to send the checkPrereqs \\nmessage to Student. Thus, the Student object does not participate in this scenario.\\nThere is another difference between this scenario and the previous one. In this \\nscenario, when the incrementClassSize operation within Course Offering calls isClass-\\nFull, the value returned is “true.” Before returning control to “a New Registration,” \\nthe incrementClassSize operation self-delegates again, this time calling setStatus to \\nset the status of the class to “closed.”\\nBoth of the sequence diagrams we have seen so far are in instance form. In \\nFigure 7-42, we present a sequence diagram in generic form. This diagram encom-\\npasses all possible combinations of conditions for the Prereq courses not completed \\nuse case (see Figure 7-26). Because this use case is an extension of the Class registra-\\ntion use case, we have not shown the Registration Window object. It is assumed that \\nthe Registration Entry object has already been created by the original use case. To \\nimprove coherency, we have provided a textual description in the left margin. You \\nmay provide such descriptions in either the left or the right margins, but try to align \\nthe text horizontally with the corresponding element in the diagram. The contents \\nof the use case are described as follows:\\n1. If the student has not taken one or more of the prerequisites for the course he or \\nshe wants to register for, check if the student has been granted a waiver for each \\nof those prerequisites.\\n2. If a waiver was not granted for one or more of the prerequisites not taken, then \\ncheck if the student tested out of each of those prerequisites by taking an exam.\\n3. If the student did not test out of any of those prerequisites, then deny registra-\\ntion. Otherwise, register the student for the class and provide a confirmation.'),\n",

This message invokes the checkWaiver operation within Student to find \\nout if the student has been granted waivers on all the prerequisites he or she has \\nnot taken. Note that the operation has to be applied to each of the prerequisites not \\ntaken. The iteration is described in the text in the left margin.\\nThe diagram also exhibits branching, with multiple arrows leaving a single \\npoint. Each branch is labeled by a guard condition. The first instance of branch -\\ning is based on the value returned by the checkWaiver operation. If checkWaiver \\n=“true,” the system creates “a New Registration” object, bypassing other opera-\\ntions. If checkWaiver =“false”—meaning that some of the prerequisites in ques-\\ntion were not waived—Registration Entry sends another message, checkExam, to \\nStudent to check if he or she tested out of each of the prerequisite courses not \\nwaived.\\nThere is another instance of branching at this point. If checkExam =“false,” \\nRegistration Entry sends a message (to Registration Window), denying the registra-\\ntion and exiting the system. We have deliberately bent the message line downward \\nto show that none of the other remaining interactions take place.

(The interested reader is referred to the BPMN stan-\\ndards and numerous other documents to learn about all of \\nthe various aspects of the complete BPMN standard. See \\nthe reference list at the end of the appendix.) However, \\nthere are four basic concepts in BPMN, each of which has \\nits own basic symbol. These basic concepts are events, ac-\\ntivities, gateways, and flows. Their symbols are as follows:\\nAt the heart of just about any information system de-\\nveloped for organizations, there is a business process. A \\nbusiness process is a standard method for accomplish-\\ning a particular task necessary for an organization to \\nfunction. A business process can come from any busi-\\nness function, from accounting to supply chain man-\\nagement to after-sales service. It can cross business \\nfunctions as well. A business process can be simple or \\ncomplex, but the more complex it is, the harder it is to \\nautomate. Complexity also makes a process more diffi-\\ncult to understand for those who are not familiar with \\nit. Communication tools are needed to describe business \\nprocesses to those who need to know about them, such as \\nsystems analysts, but who have no firsthand knowledge of \\nthe processes. There are many ways to represent business \\nprocesses, from data flow diagrams to activity diagrams. \\nThe Object Management Group (OMG), the same group \\nthat is responsible for standards for object-oriented pro-\\ngramming, has established a specific modeling approach \\nfor business processes. It is called Business Process \\nModeling Notation (BPMN). This appendix provides a \\nvery brief introduction to BPMN. First, we will introduce \\nyou to the basic notation in BPMN, and second, we will \\nprovide a couple of examples.

The symbol for an event \\nis a circle. For a starting event, the walls of the circle are thin. For the ending event, \\nthe walls are thicker. A starting event can be colored green, and an ending event can \\nbe colored red. An activity is some action that must take place for the process to be \\ncompleted. An activity can be completed by people or by a computerized system. The \\nsymbol for an activity is a rectangle with rounded edges. A gateway, symbolized by a \\ndiamond, is a decision point. The final primary concept is flow, represented by an \\narrow. Flow shows sequence, the order in which activities occur. A simple example, \\nwithout content, of a process represented by BPMN, is as follows:\\nevent\\nIn business process modeling, a trigger that \\ninitiates the start of a process.\\nActivity\\nIn business process modeling, an action \\nthat must take place for a process to be \\ncompleted.\\ngateway\\nIn business process modeling, a decision \\npoint.\\nFlow\\nIn business process modeling, it shows the \\nsequence of action in a process.\\nIn this simple example, you see that the business process starts with some event, \\nshown with an event symbol on the left. BPMN diagrams are always read from left to \\nright. The event is followed by the first activity. An arrow symbolizing flow connects \\nthe event to the activity. The first activity is followed by a gateway. This is a deci-\\nsion point, indicated by two choices: “Yes” and “No.” Some condition is associated \\nwith the gateway, and that condition can either be met (Yes) or not (No). Whether \\nthe condition is met or not determines where the flow goes next in the diagram. \\nBoth conditions lead to an additional activity. If the flow goes through the top of \\nthe diagram, there is one more activity that takes place before the process ends at its \\nending event. If the flow goes through the bottom part of the diagram, the process \\nconcludes after just one activity is completed. Note how the walls of the circle that \\nrepresents the final event are much thicker than those of the circle representing the \\nbeginning event.\\nTypically gateways are exclusive, which is to say that flow must follow only one \\npath out of the gateway and only one downstream activity can take place. However, a \\ngateway may be inclusive, which means that more than one downstream activity can \\noccur. If a gateway is inclusive, the downstream activities that follow it must also be \\nfollowed by a merge gateway, where all the flows come back together. Such a situation \\nwould look like this:\\nIn this example, both or either of the activities that follow the gateway could \\noccur. The merge gateway follows the activities, reuniting the two possible flows into \\na single flow. Note that the symbol for an inclusive gateway adds a circle inside the \\ndiamond. If it is necessary to indicate an exclusive gateway, you can add an “X” to the \\ninside of the diamond.\\nIn fact, there are three different types of gateways in BPMN. The gateway with \\nan X inside is called an exclusive OR gateway (XOR), meaning that only one of the \\npaths that exit the gateway can be followed. The gateway with a ‘plus’ sign inside \\nis an AND gateway. This means that all of the paths that follow the gateway can be \\nfollowed in parallel. The third type of gateway is the OR gateway, symbolized by '),\n",

An OR gateway means that at least one path out of the \\ngateway must be followed, but many or even all of the paths that leave the gateway \\ncan be engaged.\\nFigure 7-44 shows a process that includes an XOR gateway. After activity N is \\nfinished, there is an exclusive choice of which action to undertake. Based on the \\nnotation, if the value found at the gateway is ‘a,’ then activity A is performed. If the \\nvalue at the gateway is ‘b,’ then activity B is performed. If the value is ‘c,’ then activity \\nC is performed. But only one of these paths can be followed. Once activity A or B or \\nC is performed, all of the paths merge together at the second gateway, and activity D \\ncan be performed.\\nFigure 7-45 illustrates a process that includes an AND gateway and an XOR \\ngateway. We again read the BPMN diagram from left to right. After activity N is com-\\nplete, we come to an AND gateway. This means that both of the paths that follow the \\ngateway must be followed. The top path leads to an XOR gateway. As we have seen, \\nthe XOR gateway means only one path that leads from it can be followed. If the value \\nfound at the XOR gateway is ‘a,’ activity A is performed. If the value at the gateway is \\n‘b,’ then activity B is performed. Activity C is performed in parallel with either activ-\\nity A or B. After either A or B is performed, the paths merge to the closing XOR gate-\\nway. The path that leaves the XOR gateway and the path that leaves activity C then \\nboth merge at the next AND gateway. Now activity D can be performed, completing \\nthe process.\\nAlthough it is beyond the scope of this appendix to introduce all of the special-\\nized varieties of the four basic concepts in BPMN, it is useful to present a few variet-\\nies of some of the concepts. For example, here are the symbols for a couple of types \\nof events. They both feature the basic circle as a symbol for an event, but each one \\nhas something inside. The first has an envelope inside, and the envelope stands for \\na message. An event shown like this, at the beginning of a process, means that the \\nprocess starts with a message. A message is a basic flow of information, such as the re-\\nceipt of an order or of a customer inquiry. The other event symbol has a clock inside. \\n/Multiply\\nDoneStart\\nNA\\nB\\nC\\nAction?\\na\\nb\\nc\\nD/Multiply\\nFigure 7-44 \\nAn XOR gateway.\\nDone\\nA\\nAction?\\na\\nb\\nD/Multiply/Plus\\nStart\\nN\\nC\\n/Plus\\nB\\n/Multiply\\nFigure 7-45 \\nA process featuring an AND \\ngateway and an XOR gateway.'),\n",

In both cases, the starting event is triggered by an action outside the process \\nitself, either a message or a particular time.\\nAnother example of variations in a basic concept appears below, for flow. You \\nhave seen the basic symbol for flow, the arrow. The next symbol for flow includes a \\nslashing line near its beginning. This indicates a default flow, and you will usually see \\nthis symbol after a gateway. It shows that flow through a gateway typically follows one \\npath out of those available. The third flow symbol is a little different. The arrow line is \\ndotted, and it begins with a circle. This symbol is used to signify the flow of a message \\nrather than the flow of sequence from one activity to the next.\\nWe have presented just a few of the many variations in BPMN available for the \\nbasic concepts. There are many more, and all of them are designed to address very \\nspecific circumstances. Having all of these variations available makes BPMN very precise \\nand therefore very powerful. However, all of the variations also make BPMN relatively \\ncomplex and harder to learn than diagramming notations that employ less variety.\\nWe present a simple example of a BPMN diagram in Figure 7-46. It is a process \\nfor ordering a pizza. The first activity involves browsing the menu for your favorite pizza \\nsource, whether it is a restaurant or a delivery service. Once you know what you want, \\nyou call to order the pizza. Then the delivery person comes to your apartment, and you \\ntake delivery of the pizza. Next, there is an XOR gateway, so you can do only one of the \\ntwo things that follow. You want to know if the pizza that was delivered is the same as the \\none that you ordered. If it is, you pay for the pizza. If not, then you return it to the de-\\nlivery person. After one or the other of these activities has been performed, both paths \\nend at the XOR merge gateway. And then the overall process ends.\\nBefore we leave this section on notation, we need to address one other concept: \\nswimlanes. A process diagram can be depicted with or without a swimlane, which is a \\nway to visually encapsulate a process. Swimlanes can be depicted either vertically or \\nhorizontally. Whether a swimlane is used or not, the diagram shows only one process \\nwith one actor. If more than one actor is part of the process, then the process diagram \\nis shown in a pool. A pool is made up of at least two swimlanes, each of which focuses \\non the actions of one participant. The participant need not be a single person; it can \\nbe a team or a department that participates in a part of the process. Pools can also be \\ndepicted vertically or horizontally. When a pool is used in a business process diagram, \\nit is called a collaboration diagram.\\nSwimlane\\nIn business process modeling, a way to \\nvisually encapsulate a process.\\nPool\\nIn business process modeling, a way to \\nencapsulate a process that has two or more \\nparticipants.\\nFlow: sequence\\nFlow: default\\nFlow: massage\\n/MultiplyBrowse\\nmenu\\nCall to\\norder\\npizza\\nTake\\ndelivery\\nPay for\\npizza\\nReturn\\npizza\\n[OK]\\n[Order not OK]\\n/Multiply\\nFigure 7-46 \\nA simple BPMN example.\\nLANE\\nLANE'),\n",

The process depicted is recruiting. There are three partici-\\npants: the job applicant (shown in a swimlane), a manager, and a Human Resources \\n(HR) department. The manager and HR department are in the same company and \\nso are both shown in a pool. All communication between the company (pool) and \\nthe applicant (swimlane) is done through messaging. Note the lines indicating com-\\nmunication between the applicant and the organization are dotted lines and feature \\nenvelopes at midline. The envelopes symbolize messages, or information.\\nTo read the diagram, start at the top left, with the event symbol in the manager’s \\nlane in the company pool. Then continue to read from left to right. Follow the arrows, \\nwhich indicate flow up, down, and across. The manager needs to recruit someone for \\na job, so she creates an advertisement for the job. Flow control then passes to the HR \\ndepartment, where the ad is reviewed and then posted. At this point, a job applicant \\nsees the ad and completes and returns an application. The application is received by \\nHR, where it is evaluated and passed on to the manager. The manager evaluates the \\napplication and then must decide whether or not to interview the applicant. This \\ndecision is indicated by the gateway symbol. There are two possible outcomes: yes, \\ninterview the applicant, or no, don’t interview the applicant. If the decision is “no,” \\nthen the manager notifies HR. HR notifies the applicant, and the applicant must \\ndecide what to do next. The process ends for both the company and the applicant. \\nIf the decision is “yes,” then the applicant takes part in an interview. The results are \\nevaluated by the manager. At this point, whether the manager decides to hire the ap-\\nplicant or not, she notifies HR of her decision, and HR then notifies the applicant. \\nThe applicant must decide on his next step, and the process ends for all involved.\\nObviously, the recruiting process has been simplified for this example.

None of the techniques \\ndiscussed so far, however, has concentrated on the data \\nthat must be retained in order to support the data flows \\nand processing described. For example, you learned \\nhow to show data stores, or data at rest, in a data flow di-\\nagram (DFD). The natural structure of data, however, was \\nnot shown. DFDs, use cases, and various processing logic \\ntechniques show how, where, and when data are used or \\nchanged in an information system, but these  techniques \\ndo not show the definition, structure, and relationships \\nwithin the data. Data modeling develops these missing, \\nand crucial, descriptive pieces of a system.\\nIn fact, some systems developers believe that a \\ndata model is the most important part of the statement \\nof information system requirements. This belief is based \\non the following reasons. First, the characteristics of data \\ncaptured during data modeling are crucial in the design \\nof databases, programs, computer screens, and printed \\nreports. For example, facts such as these—a data element \\nis numeric, a product can be in only one product line at a \\ntime, a line item on a customer order can never be moved \\nto another customer order, customer region name is \\n limited to a specified set of values—are all essential pieces \\nof information in ensuring data integrity in an informa-\\ntion system.\\nSecond, data, not processes, are the most complex \\naspects of many modern information systems and hence \\nrequire a central role in structuring system requirements. \\nTransaction processing systems can have considerable \\nprocess complexity in validating data, reconciling errors, \\nand coordinating the movement of data to various data-\\nbases. Current systems development focuses more on \\nmanagement information systems (such as sales tracking), \\n decision support systems (such as short-term cash invest-\\nment), and business intelligence systems (such as market \\nbasket analysis). Such systems are more data intensive. \\nThe exact nature of processing is also more ad hoc than \\nwith transaction processing systems, so the details of pro-\\ncessing steps cannot be anticipated. Thus, the goal is to \\nprovide a rich data resource that might support any type \\nof information inquiry, analysis, and summarization.\\nThird, the characteristics about data (e.g., length, \\nformat, and relationships with other data) are reason-\\nably permanent and have significant similarity for differ-\\nent organizations in the same business. In contrast, the \\n8.4 distinguish among unary, binary, and ternary \\nrelationships as well as associative entities, \\nproviding an example of each;\\n8.5 define supertypes and subtypes, showing how to \\nrepresent these entity types with entity-relationship \\ndiagramming notation;\\n8.6 define four basic types of business rules in a \\nconceptual data model; and\\n8.7 explain the role of prepackaged database models \\n(patterns) in data modeling.\\nLearning Objectives\\nAfter studying this chapter, you should be able to\\n8.1 explain the role of conceptual data modeling in the \\noverall analysis and design of an information \\nsystem;\\n8.2 describe the information gathering process for \\nconceptual data modeling;\\n8.3 describe how to represent an entity-relationship \\nmodel and be able to define the terms: entity type, \\nattribute, identifier, multivalued attribute, and \\nrelationship;\\nStructuring System  \\nData Requirements8\\nChapter \\nIntroduction'),\n",

A data model explains the inherent \\nnature of the organization, not its transient form. Therefore, an information system \\ndesign based on a data orientation, rather than a process or logic orientation, should \\nhave a longer useful life and should have common features for the same applications \\nor domains in different organizations. Finally, structural information about data is \\nessential for automatic program generation. For example, the fact that a customer \\norder has many line items on it instead of just one line item affects the automatic \\ndesign of a computer screen for entry of customer orders. Although a data model \\nspecifically documents the file and database requirements for an information sys-\\ntem, the business meaning, or semantics, of data included in the data model has a \\nbroader effect on the design and construction of a system.\\nThe most common format used for data modeling is entity-relationship (E-R) dia-\\ngramming. A similar format used with object-oriented analysis and design methods \\nis class diagramming, which is included in a special section at the end of this chapter \\non the object-oriented development approach to data modeling. Data models that \\nuse E-R and class diagram notations explain the characteristics and structure of data \\nindependent of how the data may be stored in computer memory. A data model is \\nusually developed iteratively, either from scratch or from a purchased data model \\nfor the industry or business area to be supported. Information system (IS) planners \\nuse this preliminary data model to develop an enterprise-wide data model with very \\nbroad categories of data and little detail. Next, during the definition of a project, a \\nspecific data model is built to help explain the scope of a particular systems analysis \\nand design effort. During requirements structuring, a data model represents con-\\nceptual data requirements for a particular system. Then, after system inputs and \\noutputs are fully described during logical design, the data model is refined before \\nit is translated into a logical format (typically a relational data model) from which \\ndatabase definition and physical database design are done. A data model represents \\ncertain types of business rules that govern the properties of data. Business rules are \\nimportant statements of business policies that ideally will be enforced through the \\ndatabase and database management system ultimately used for the application you \\nare designing. Thus, you will use E-R and class diagramming in many systems devel-\\nopment project steps, and most IS project members need to know how to develop \\nand read data model diagrams. Therefore, mastery of the requirements structuring \\nmethods and techniques addressed in this chapter is critical to your success on a sys-\\ntems development project team.\\nConCeptual Data MoDeling\\nA conceptual data model is a representation of organizational data. The purpose of a \\nconceptual data model is to show as many rules about the meaning and interrelation-\\nships among data as are possible.\\nConceptual data modeling is typically done in parallel with other requirements \\nanalysis and structuring steps during systems analysis (see Figure 8-1), as outlined in \\nprior chapters. On larger systems development teams, a subset of the project team \\nconcentrates on data modeling while other team members focus attention on pro-\\ncess or logic modeling. Analysts develop (or use from prior systems development) a \\nconceptual data model for the current system and then build or refine a purchased \\nconceptual data model that supports the scope and requirements for the proposed \\nor enhanced system.\\nThe work of all team members is coordinated and shared through the project \\ndictionary or repository. This repository is often maintained by a common Computer-\\nAided Software Engineering (CASE) or data modeling software tool, but some orga-\\nnizations still use spreadsheets and other types of files to store data descriptions and \\nother important information. No matter how the information is stored, it is essen-\\ntial that the process, logic, and data model descriptions of a system are consistent \\nConceptual data model\\nA detailed model that captures the overall \\nstructure of organizational data that is \\nindependent of any database management \\nsystem or other implementation \\nconsiderations.'),\n",

For example, the names of data stores on the primitive-\\nlevel DFDs often correspond to the names of data entities in E-R diagrams, and the \\ndata elements associated with data flows on DFDs must be accounted for by attributes \\nof entities and relationships in E-R diagrams.\\nthe Conceptual Data Modeling process\\nThe process of conceptual data modeling begins with developing a conceptual data \\nmodel for the system being replaced, if a system already exists. This is essential for \\nplanning the conversion of the current files or database into the database of the \\nnew system. Further, this is a good, but not a perfect, starting point for your under-\\nstanding of the data requirements of the new system. Then, a new conceptual data \\nmodel is built (or a standard one is purchased) that includes all of the data require-\\nments for the new system. You discovered these requirements from the fact-finding \\nmethods employed during requirements determination. Today, given the popularity \\nof rapid development methodologies, such as the use of predefined patterns, these \\nrequirements often evolve through various iterations from some starting point in a \\npurchased application or database design. Even when developed from scratch, data \\nmodeling is an iterative process with many checkpoints.\\nConceptual data modeling is one kind of data modeling and database design car-\\nried out throughout the systems development process. Figure 8-2 shows the different \\nkinds of data modeling and database design that go on during the whole systems devel-\\nopment life cycle (SDLC). The conceptual data modeling methods we discuss in this \\nchapter are suitable for the planning and analysis phases; these methods can be used \\nwith either a data model developed from scratch or based on a purchased data model. \\nThe planning phase of the SDLC addresses issues of system scope, general require-\\nments, and content independent of technical implementation. E-R and class diagram-\\nming are suited for this phase because these diagrams can be translated into a wide \\nvariety of technical architectures for data, such as relational, network, and hierarchi-\\ncal architectures. A data model evolves from the early stages of planning through the \\nanalysis phase as it becomes more specific and is validated by more detailed analyses of \\nsystem needs.\\nIn the design phase, the final data model developed in analysis is matched with \\ndesigns for systems inputs and outputs and is translated into a format from which \\nphysical data storage decisions can be made. After specific data storage architec-\\ntures are selected, then files and databases are defined as the system is coded during \\nimplementation.

Thus, the data modeling and design steps in each \\nof the SDLC phases are linked through the project repository.\\nDeliverables and outcomes\\nMost organizations today do conceptual data modeling using E-R modeling, which \\nuses a special notation to represent as much meaning about data as possible. Because \\nof the rapidly increasing interest in object-oriented methods, class diagrams using \\nunified modeling language (UML) drawing tools such as IBM’s Rational products \\nor Microsoft Visio are also popular. We will focus first on E-R diagramming and then \\nlater show how it differs from class diagramming.\\nThe primary deliverable from the conceptual data modeling step within the \\nanalysis phase is an E-R diagram, similar to the one shown in Figure 8-3. This figure \\nshows the major categories of data (rectangles on the diagram) and the business \\nrelationships between them (lines connecting rectangles). For example, Figure 8-3 \\nshows that, for the business represented by this diagram, a SUPPLIER sometimes \\nSupplies ITEMs to the company, and an ITEM is always Supplied by one to four \\nSUPPLIERS. The fact that a supplier only sometimes supplies items implies that the \\nbusiness wants to keep track of some suppliers without designating what they can \\nsupply. This diagram includes two names on each line so that a relationship can \\nbe read in each direction. For simplicity, we will not typically include two names \\non lines in E-R diagrams in this book; however, this is a standard used in many \\norganizations.\\nThe other deliverable from conceptual data modeling is a full set of entries \\nabout data objects that will be stored in the project dictionary, repository, or data \\nmodeling software. The repository is the mechanism that links the data, processes, \\nand logic models of an information system. For example, there are explicit links \\nbetween a data model and a DFD. Some important links are explained briefly here.\\n•\\t Data elements included in data flows also appear in the data model, and vice versa. \\nYou must include in the data model any raw data captured and retained in a data \\nstore, and a data model can include only data that have been captured or that have \\nDesignImplementation\\nPlanning\\nMaintenance Analysis\\n• Enterprise-wide data model (E-R with only entities)\\n• Conceptual data model (E-R with only entities for\\n speciﬁc project)\\n• Data model\\n evolution\\n• Database and ﬁle deﬁnitions\\n (DBMS-speciﬁc code)\\n• Logical data model (relational)\\n and physical ﬁle and database\\n design (ﬁle organizations)\\n• Conceptual data\\n models (E-R with\\n attributes)\\nFigure 8-2 \\nRelationship between data \\nmodeling and the SDLC'),\n",

Because a data model is a general business \\npicture of data, both manual and automated data stores will be included.\\n•\\t Each data store in a process model must relate to business objects (what we will \\ncall data entities) represented in the data model. For example, in Figure 7-5, the \\nInventory File data store must correspond to one or several data objects on a data \\nmodel.\\nYou can use an automated repository to verify these linkages.\\ngatheRing infoRMation foR ConCeptual \\nData MoDeling\\nRequirements determination methods must include questions and investigations that \\ntake a data, not only a process and logic, focus. For example, during interviews with \\npotential system users—during Joint Application Design (JAD) sessions or through \\nrequirements interviews—you must ask specific questions in order to gain the per-\\nspective on data that you need to develop or tailor a purchased data model. In later \\nsections of this chapter, we will introduce some specific terminology and constructs \\nused in data modeling. Even without this specific data modeling language, you can \\nbegin to understand the kinds of questions that must be answered during require-\\nments determination. These questions relate to understanding the rules and policies \\nby which the area to be supported by the new information system operates. That is, \\na data model explains what the organization does and what rules govern how work is \\nperformed in the organization. You do not, however, need to know (and often can’t \\nfully anticipate) how or when data are processed or used to do data modeling.\\nYou typically do data modeling from a combination of perspectives. The first \\nperspective is generally called the top-down approach. This perspective derives the \\nbusiness rules for a data model from an intimate understanding of the nature of \\nthe business, rather than from any specific information requirements in computer \\ndisplays, reports, or business forms. It is this perspective that is typically the basis \\nfor a purchased data model. Several very useful sources of typical questions to elicit \\nthe business rules needed for data modeling can be found in Gottesdiener (1999), \\nSUPPLIER ORDER\\nPRODUCTSHIPMENT\\nENTITY\\nTYPE\\nCUSTOMER\\nITEM\\nRelationship\\nKey\\nSends\\nSupplies Submits\\n4 Submitted_by\\nRequests\\nRequested_on\\nUsed_in\\nUses\\nSent_by\\nSupplied_by\\nIncludes\\nIncluded_on\\nCardinalities\\nMandatory One Optional One\\nMandatory Many Optional Many\\nFigure 8-3 \\nSample conceptual data model'),\n",

Table 8-1 summarizes a few key questions you should \\nask system users and business managers so that you can develop an accurate and \\ncomplete data model tailored to the particular situation. The questions in this table \\nare purposely posed in business terms. You can ask these questions whether you start \\nwith a clean sheet of paper or a purchased data model, but typically the questions are \\nmore obvious and thorough when you begin the data modeling project with a pur-\\nchased data model for the industry or application under development. In this chapter, \\nyou will learn the more technical terms included in bold at the end of each set of ques-\\ntions. Of course, these technical terms do not mean much to a business manager, so \\nyou must learn how to frame your questions in business terms for your investigation.\\nYou can also gather the information you need for data modeling by review-\\ning specific business documents—computer displays, reports, and business forms—\\nhandled within the system. This process of gaining an understanding of data is often \\ncalled a bottom-up approach. These items will appear as data flows on DFDs and will \\nshow the data processed by the system and, hence, probably the data that must be \\nmaintained in the system’s database. Consider, for example, Figure 8-4, which shows \\na customer order form used at Pine Valley Furniture (PVF). From this form, we deter-\\nmine that the following data must be kept in the database:\\nORDER NO CUSTOMER NO\\nORDER DATE NAME\\nPROMISED DATE ADDRESS\\nPRODUCT NO CITY-STATE-ZIP\\nDESCRIPTION\\nQUANTITY ORDERED\\nUNIT PRICE\\nTable 8-1  Requirements Determination Questions for Data Modeling\\n1.

How many instances of each object might exist?—data entities and their \\ndescriptions\\n2. What unique characteristic (or characteristics) distinguishes each object from other  \\nobjects of the same type? Might this distinguishing feature change over time or is it \\npermanent? Might this characteristic of an object be missing even though we know the \\nobject exists?—primary key\\n3. What characteristics describe each object? On what basis are objects referenced, selected, \\nqualified, sorted, and categorized? What must we know about each object in order to run  \\nthe business?—attributes and secondary keys\\n4.

We will use this understanding of an orga-\\nnization’s operation to develop data models.\\nintRoDuCtion to e-R MoDeling\\nThe basic E-R modeling notation uses three main constructs: data entities, relation -\\nships, and their associated attributes. Several different E-R notations exist, and many \\nCASE and E-R drawing programs support multiple notations. For simplicity, we have \\nadopted one common notation for this book; this notation uses the so-called crow’s \\nfoot symbols and places data attribute names within entity rectangles. This notation \\nis very similar to that used by many E-R drawing tools, including Microsoft Visio®. If \\nyou use another notation in courses or at work, you should be able to easily translate \\nbetween notations.\\nAn entity-relationship data model (E-R model) is a detailed, logical representation \\nof the data for an organization or for a business area. The E-R model is  expressed in \\nterms of entities in the business environment, the relationships or associations among \\nthose entities, and the attributes or properties of both the entities and their relation-\\nships. An E-R model is normally expressed as an entity-relationship diagram (E-R \\n diagram), which is a graphical representation of an E-R model. The notation we will use \\nfor E-R diagrams appears in Figure 8-5, and subsequent sections explain this notation.\\nentities\\nAn entity (see the first question in Table 8-1) is a person, place, object, event, or \\nconcept in the user environment about which the organization wishes to maintain \\ndata. An entity has its own identity that distinguishes it from each other entity. Some \\nexamples of entities follow: \\n•\\t Person: EMPLOYEE, STUDENT, PATIENT\\n•\\t Place: STORE, WAREHOUSE, STATE\\n•\\t Object: MACHINE, BUILDING, AUTOMOBILE, PRODUCT\\n•\\t Event: SALE, REGISTRATION, RENEWAL\\n•\\t Concept: ACCOUNT, COURSE, WORK CENTER\\nThere is an important distinction between entity types and entity instances. \\nAn entity type (sometimes called an entity class) is a collection of entities that share \\ncommon properties or characteristics. Each entity type in an E-R model is given a \\nname. Because the name represents a class or set, it is singular. Also, because an \\nentity is an object, we use a simple noun to name an entity type. We use capital letters \\nentity-relationship data \\nmodel (e-r model)\\nA detailed, logical representation of the \\nentities, associations, and data elements for \\nan organization or business area.\\nentity-relationship diagram \\n(e-r diagram)\\nA graphical representation of an E-R model.\\nentity type\\nA collection of entities that share common \\nproperties or characteristics.\\nPVF CUSTOMER ORDER\\nORDER NO: 6138 4C USTOMER NO: 1273\\nNAME:C ontemporary Designs\\nADDRESS: 123 Oak St.\\nCITY -STA TE-ZIP: Austin, TX 28384\\nORDER DATE: 11/04/2014 PROMISED DATE: 11/21/2017\\nPRODUCT QUANTITY UNIT\\nPRICENO DESCRI PTION ORDERED\\nM128 Bookcase 4 200.00\\nB381 Cabinet 2 150.00\\nR210 T able 1 500.00\\nFigure 8-4 \\nSample customer form'),\n",

An entity type is described just once in a data model, whereas many \\ninstances of that entity type may be represented by data stored in the database. For \\nexample, there is one EMPLOYEE entity type in most organizations, but there may be \\nhundreds (or even thousands) of instances of this entity type stored in the database.\\nA common mistake many people make when they are just learning to draw \\nE-R diagrams, especially if they already know how to do data flow diagramming, is \\nto confuse data entities with sources/sinks or system outputs and relationships with \\ndata flows. A simple rule to avoid such confusion is that a true data entity will have \\nmany possible instances, each with a distinguishing characteristic, as well as one or \\nmore other descriptive pieces of data. Consider the entity types that might be associ-\\nated with a sorority expense system, as represented in Figure 8-6b. In this situation, \\nthe sorority treasurer manages accounts and records expense transactions against \\neach account. However, do we need to keep track of data about the treasurer and her \\nsupervision of accounts as part of this accounting system? The treasurer is the per-\\nson entering data about accounts and expenses and making inquiries about account \\nbalances and expense transactions by category. Because there is only one treasurer, \\nTREASURER data do not need to be kept. On the other hand, if each account has an \\naccount manager (e.g., a sorority officer) who is responsible for assigned accounts, \\nentity instance\\nA single occurrence of an entity type.

Because an expense \\nreport is computed from expense transactions and account balances, it is a data \\nflow, not an entity type. Even though there will be multiple instances of expense \\nreports over time, the report contents are already represented by the ACCOUNT and \\nEXPENSE entity types.\\nOften when we refer to entity types in subsequent sections, we will simply say \\nentity. This is common among data modelers. We will clarify that we mean an entity \\nby use of the term entity instance.\\nNaming and Defining Entity Types  Clearly naming and defining data, such as \\nentity types, are important tasks during requirements determination and structuring. \\nWhen naming and defining entity types, you should use the following guidelines:\\n•\\t An entity type name is a singular noun (such as CUSTOMER, STUDENT, or \\nAUTOMOBILE).\\n•\\t An entity type name should be descriptive and specific to the organization. \\nFor example, a PURCHASE ORDER for orders placed with suppliers is distinct \\nfrom CUSTOMER ORDER for orders placed by customers. Both of these entity \\ntypes cannot be named ORDER.\\n•\\t An entity type name should be concise. For example, in a university database, use \\nREGISTRATION for the event of a student registering for a class rather than \\nSTUDENT REGISTRATION FOR CLASS.\\n•\\t Event entity types should be named for the result of the event, not the activity or \\nprocess of the event. For example, the event of a project manager assigning an \\nemployee to work on a project results in an ASSIGNMENT.\\nSome specific guidelines for defining entity types follow:\\n•\\t An entity type definition should include a statement of what the unique characteristic(s) \\nis (are) for each instance of the entity type.\\n•\\t An entity type definition should make clear what entity instances are included and \\nnot included in the entity type. For example, “A customer is a person or organiza-\\ntion that has placed an order for a product from us or that we have contacted \\nto advertise or promote our products. A customer does not include persons or \\norganizations that buy our products only through our customers, distributors, \\nor\\xa0agents.”\\n•\\t An entity type definition often includes a description of when an instance of the \\nentity type is created and deleted.\\n•\\t For some entity types, the definition must specify when an instance might change \\ninto an instance of another entity type; for example, a bid for a construction company \\nbecomes a contract once it is accepted.\\n•\\t For some entity types, the definition must specify what history is to be kept about \\nentity instances. Statements about keeping history may have ramifications about \\nhow we represent the entity type on an E-R diagram and eventually how we store \\ndata for the entity instances.\\nattributes\\nEach entity type has a set of attributes (see the third question in Table 8-1) associated \\nwith it. An attribute is a property or characteristic of an entity that is of interest to the \\norganization (relationships may also have attributes, as we will see in the section on \\nrelationships). Following are some typical entity types and associated attributes:\\nSTUDENT: Student_ID, Student_Name, Home_Address, Phone_Number, \\nMajor\\nAUTOMOBILE: Vehicle_ID, Color, Weight, Horsepower\\nEMPLOYEE: Employee_ID, Employee_Name, Payroll_Address, Skill\\nAttribute\\nA named property or characteristic of an \\nentity that is of interest to the organization.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\ASUS\\\\Desktop\\\\AI powered chatbot\\\\Data\\\\SAD.pdf', 'page': 288}, page_content='264 Part III   AnAlysis\\nWe use an initial capital letter, followed by lowercase letters, and nouns in nam-\\ning an attribute; underscores may or may not be used to separate words. In E-R dia-\\ngrams, we represent an attribute by placing its name inside the rectangle for the \\nassociated entity (see Figure 8-5). We use different notations for attributes to distin-\\nguish between different types of attributes, which we describe below. Our notation is \\nsimilar to that used by many CASE and E-R drawing tools, such as Microsoft Visio or \\nOracle’s Designer. Precisely how different types of attributes are shown varies by tool.\\nNaming and Defining Attributes  Often several attributes have approximately the \\nsame name and meaning. Thus, it is important to carefully name attributes using the \\nfollowing guidelines:\\n•\\t An attribute name is a noun (such as Customer_ID, Age, or Product_Minimum_ \\nPrice).\\n•\\t An attribute name should be unique. No two attributes of the same entity type \\nmay have the same name, and it is desirable, for clarity, that no two attributes \\nacross all entity types have the same name.\\n•\\t To make an attribute name unique and for clarity, each attribute name should follow \\na standard format. For example, your university may establish Student_GPA, as \\nopposed to GPA_of_Student, as an example of the standard format for attribute \\nnaming.\\n•\\t Similar attributes of different entity types should use similar but distinguishing names; for \\nexample, the city of residence for faculty and students should be, respectively, \\nFaculty_Residence_City_Name and Student_Residence_City_Name.\\nSome specific guidelines for defining attributes follow:\\n•\\t An attribute definition states what the attribute is and possibly why it is important.\\n•\\t An attribute definition should make it clear what is included and what is not included \\nin the attribute’s value; for example, “Employee_Monthly_ Salary_ Amount is the \\namount of money paid each month in the currency of the  country of residence \\nof the employee exclusive of any benefits, bonuses,  reimbursements, or special \\npayments.”\\n•\\t Any aliases, or alternative names, for the attribute can be specified in the definition.\\n•\\t It may also be desirable to state in the definition the source of values for the attribute. \\nStating the source may make the meaning of the data clearer.\\n•\\t An attribute definition should indicate if a value for the attribute is required or optional. \\nThis business rule about an attribute is important for maintaining data integrity.\\n•\\t An attribute definition may indicate if a value for the attribute may change once a \\nvalue is provided and before the entity instance is deleted. This business rule also \\ncontrols data integrity.\\n•\\t An attribute definition may also indicate any relationships that attribute has with \\nother attributes; for example, “Employee_Vacation_Days_Number is the number \\nof days of paid vacation for the employee. If the employee has a value of ‘Exempt’ \\nfor Employee_Type, then the maximum value for Employee_ Vacation_Days_\\nNumber is determined by a formula involving the number of years of service for \\nthe employee.”\\nCandidate Keys and identifiers\\nEvery entity type must have an attribute or set of attributes that distinguishes one in-\\nstance from other instances of the same type (see the second question in Table 8-1). \\nA candidate key is an attribute (or combination of attributes) that uniquely identifies \\neach instance of an entity type. A candidate key for a STUDENT entity type might be \\nStudent_ID.\\nSometimes a combination of attributes is required to identify a unique entity. \\nFor example, consider the entity type GAME for a basketball league. The attribute \\nCandidate key\\nAn attribute (or combination of attributes) \\nthat uniquely identifies each instance of an \\nentity type.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\ASUS\\\\Desktop\\\\AI powered chatbot\\\\Data\\\\SAD.pdf', 'page': 289}, page_content=' ChaPter 8   structuring system DAtA requirements 265\\nTeam_Name is clearly not a candidate key because each team plays several games. If \\neach team plays exactly one home game against each other team, then the combina-\\ntion of the attributes Home_Team and Visiting_Team is a composite candidate key \\nfor GAME.\\nSome entities may have more than one possible candidate key. One candidate \\nkey for EMPLOYEE is Employee_ID; a second is the combination of Employee_ \\nName and Address (assuming that no two employees with the same name live at the \\nsame address). If there is more than one possible candidate key, the designer must \\nchoose one of the candidate keys as the identifier. An identifier is a candidate key \\nthat has been selected to be used as the unique characteristic for an entity type. We \\nshow the identifier attribute(s) by placing a solid underline below the identifier (see \\nFigure 8-5). Bruce (1992) suggests the following criteria for selecting identifiers:\\n•\\t Choose a candidate key that will not change its value over the life of each instance \\nof the entity type. For example, the combination of Employee_Name and Payroll_\\nAddress would probably be a poor choice as an identifier for EMPLOYEE because \\nthe values of Payroll_Address and Employee_Name could easily change during an \\nemployee’s term of employment.\\n•\\t Choose a candidate key so that, for each instance of the entity, the attribute is \\nguaranteed to have valid values and not be null. To ensure valid values, you may \\nhave to include special controls in data entry and maintenance routines to elimi-\\nnate the possibility of errors. If the candidate key is a combination of two or more \\nattributes, make sure that all parts of the key have valid values.\\n•\\t Avoid the use of so-called intelligent identifiers, whose structure indicates clas-\\nsifications, locations, and so on. For example, the first two digits of a key for a \\nPART entity may indicate the warehouse location. Such codes are often modified \\nas conditions change, which renders the primary key values invalid.\\n•\\t Consider substituting single-attribute surrogate keys for large composite keys. For \\nexample, an attribute called Game_ID could be used for the entity GAME instead \\nof the combination of Home_Team and Visiting_Team.\\nFigure 8-7 shows the representation for a STUDENT entity type using our E-R \\nnotation. STUDENT has a simple identifier, Student_ID, and three other simple \\nattributes.\\nother attribute types\\nA multivalued attribute may take on more than one value for each entity instance. \\nSuppose that Skill is one of the attributes of EMPLOYEE. If each employee can have \\nmore than one skill, Skill is a multivalued attribute. Two ways of showing multivalued \\nattributes are common. The first is to list the multivalued attribute along with other at-\\ntributes, but use a special symbol to indicate that it is multivalued. This is the approach \\ntaken in Figure 8-8a, where the multivalued attribute skill is enclosed in curly brackets.\\nSometimes a set of data repeats together. For example, consider Figure 8-8b \\nfor an employee entity with multivalued attributes for data about each employee’s \\ndependents. In this situation, data such as dependent name, age, and relation to \\nemployee (spouse, child, parent, etc.) are multivalued attributes about an employee, \\nand these attributes repeat together (we show this by using one set of curly brackets \\naround the data that repeats together). Several attributes that repeat together are \\ncalled a repeating group.\\nConceptually, dependents can also be thought of as entities. Thus, many data \\nanalysts prefer a second approach to representing a repeating group. In this approach, \\nwe separate the repeating data into another entity, called a weak (or attributive) entity \\n(designated by a rectangle with a double line border), and then use a relationship \\n(relationships are discussed in the next section) to link the weak entity to its associ-\\nated regular entity (this particular relationship is also represented by a double line). \\nWe can show this in Figure 8-8c using a weak entity, DEPENDENT, and a relationship, \\nidentifier\\nA candidate key that has been selected as \\nthe unique, identifying characteristic for an \\nentity type.\\nMultivalued attribute\\nAn attribute that may take on more than \\none value for each entity instance.\\nrepeating group\\nA set of two or more multivalued attributes \\nthat are logically related.\\nStudent_ID\\nStudent_Name\\nStudent_Campus_Address\\nStudent_Campus_Phone\\nSTUDENT\\nFigure 8-7 \\nSTUDENT entity type with attributes'),\n",

The crow’s foot next to DEPENDENT \\nmeans that there may be many DEPENDENTs for the same EMPLOYEE. The identi-\\nfier of DEPENDENT is a combination of the dependent’s name and the ID of the \\nemployee for which this person is a dependent. It is sufficient to show Dep_Name in \\nthe weak entity and use a double underline to designate it as a partial identifier.\\nIt may be important to designate whether an attribute must have a value \\n(required attribute) or may not have a value (optional attribute) for every entity \\ninstance. It is also common to have an attribute, such as Name or Address, which has \\nmeaningful component parts, which we call a composite attribute. For some applica-\\ntions, people may want to simply refer to the set of component attributes by a compos-\\nite name, whereas in other applications, we may need to display or compute with only \\nsome of the component parts. Also in conceptual modeling, users may refer to some \\ndatum that can be computed from other data in the database, a so-called derived attri-\\nbute. In order to represent these unique characteristics of attributes, many E-R draw-\\ning tools have special notations for each of these types of attributes. In this text, we \\nuse the notation found in Figure 8-5. Figure 8-9 illustrates an EMPLOYEE entity with \\neach of these types of attributes using our notation. Any identifier is required, and \\nwe have designated the composite attribute Employee_Name (with atomic compo-\\nnents First_Name and Last_Name) as also required by putting these attribute names \\nin bold. Date_of_Birth is an optional attribute. Employee_Age, also optional, can be \\ncomputed from today’s date and Date_of_Birth, so it is a derived attribute.\\nRelationships\\nRelationships are the glue that holds together the various components of an E-R \\nmodel (see the fifth, seventh, and eighth questions in Table 8-1). A relationship is an \\nassociation between the instances of one or more entity types that is of interest to the \\norganization. An association usually means that an event has occurred or that there \\nexists some natural linkage between entity instances. For this reason, relationships \\nare labeled with verb phrases.

This leads to a relationship called Completes be-\\ntween the EMPLOYEE and COURSE entity types.\\nAs indicated by the arrows, this is a many-to-many relationship: each employee \\nmay complete more than one course, and each course may be completed by more \\nthan one employee. More significantly, we can use the Completes relationship to \\ndetermine the specific courses that a given employee has completed. Conversely, we \\ncan determine the identity of each employee who has completed a particular course. \\nFor example, consider the employees and courses shown in Figure 8-10b. In this illus-\\ntration, Melton has completed three courses (C++, COBOL, and Perl) and the SQL \\ncourse has been completed by Celko and Gosling.\\nWe sometimes use two verb phrases for a relationship name so that there is an \\nexplicit name for the relationship in each direction.

The goal of conceptual data modeling is to \\n capture as much of the meaning of data as possible. The more details (business rules) \\nabout data that we can model, the better the system we can design and build. Further, \\nif we can include all these details in a CASE repository, and if a CASE tool can \\n generate code for data definitions and programs, then the more we know about data, \\nthe more code we can generate automatically. This will make system building more \\naccurate and faster. More important, if we can keep a thorough repository of data de-\\nscriptions, we can regenerate the system as the business rules change. Because main-\\ntenance is the largest expense with any information system, the efficiencies gained by \\nmaintaining systems at the rule rather than the code level drastically reduce the cost.\\nIn this section, we explore more advanced concepts needed to model data \\nmore thoroughly and learn how the E-R notation represents these concepts.\\nCompletes\\nEMPLOYEE\\nEmployee_ID\\nEmployee_Name(. . .)\\nBirth_Date\\nCOURSE\\nCourse_ID\\nCourse_Title\\n{Topic}\\n(a) Figure 8-10 \\nRelationship type and instances\\n(a) Relationship type (Completes)\\n(b) Relationship instances\\nC++\\nJava\\nCOBOL\\nVisual Basic\\nPerl\\nSQL\\nChen\\nMelton\\nRitchie\\nCelko\\nGosling\\nEmployee Course(b)'),\n",

Thus, the relationship Completes \\nillustrated in Figure 8-10a is of degree two because there are two entity types: \\nEMPLOYEE and COURSE. The three most common relationships in E-R models are \\nunary (degree one), binary (degree two), and ternary (degree three). Higher-degree \\nrelationships are possible, but they are rarely encountered in practice, so we restrict \\nour discussion to these three cases. Examples of unary, binary, and ternary relation-\\nships appear in Figure 8-11.\\nUnary Relationships  Also called a recursive relationship, a unary relationship is a \\nrelationship between the instances of one entity type. Three examples are shown in \\nFigure 8-11. In the first example, Is_married_to is shown as a one-to-one relationship \\nbetween instances of the PERSON entity type. That is, each person may be currently \\nmarried to one other person. In the second example, Manages is shown as a one-\\nto-many relationship between instances of the EMPLOYEE entity type. Using this \\nrelationship, we can identify, for example, the employees who report to a particular \\nmanager; reading the Manages relationship in the opposite direction, we can iden-\\ntify who the manager is for a given employee.

This \\nrelationship represents the sequential order of teams in a league; this sequential or -\\ndering could be based on any criteria, such as winning percentage.\\nFigure 8-12 shows an example of another common unary relationship, called \\na bill-of-materials structure. Many manufactured products are made of subassemblies, \\nwhich in turn are composed of other subassemblies and parts, and so on. As shown \\nin Figure 8-12a, we can represent this structure as a many-to-many unary relation-\\nship. In this figure, we use Has_components for the relationship name. The attribute \\nQuantity, which is a property of the relationship, indicates the number of each com-\\nponent that is contained in a given assembly.\\nTwo occurrences of this structure are shown in Figure 8-12b. Each of these dia-\\ngrams shows the immediate components of each item as well as the quantities of that \\ncomponent. For example, item TX100 consists of item BR450 (quantity 2) and item \\nDX500 (quantity 1). You can easily verify that the associations are in fact many-to-\\nmany. Several of the items have more than one component type (e.g., item MX300 \\nhas three immediate component types: HX100, TX100, and WX240). Also, some \\nof the components are used in several higher-level assemblies. For example, item \\nWX240 is used in both item MX300 and item WX340, even at different levels of the \\nbill of materials. The many-to-many relationship guarantees that, for example, the \\nsame subassembly structure of WX240 (not shown) is used each time item WX240 \\ngoes into making some other item.\\nBinary Relationships A binary relationship is a relationship between instances of \\ntwo entity types and is the most common type of relationship encountered in data \\nmodeling. Figure 8-11b shows three examples. The first (one-to-one) indicates that \\nan employee is assigned one parking place, and each parking place is assigned to one \\nemployee. The second (one-to-many) indicates that a product line may contain sev-\\neral products, and each product belongs to only one product line. The third (many-\\nto-many) shows that a student may register for more than one course, and that each \\ncourse may have many student registrants.\\nTernary Relationships A ternary relationship is a simultaneous relationship among \\ninstances of three entity types. In the example shown in Figure 8-11c, the relationship \\nBinary relationship\\nA relationship between instances of two \\nentity types.

Each entity may be a one or a many participant in a ternary \\nrelationship (in Figure 8-11, all three entities are many participants).\\nNote that a ternary relationship is not the same as three binary relationships. For \\nexample, Shipping_Mode is an attribute of the Supplies relationship in Figure\\xa08-11c. \\nShipping_Mode cannot be properly associated with any of the three possible binary \\nrelationships among the three entity types (such as that between PART and VENDOR) \\nbecause Shipping_Mode is the type of shipping carrier used for a particular PART \\nshipped from a particular VENDOR to a particular WAREHOUSE. We strongly rec-\\nommend that all ternary (and higher) relationships be represented as associative enti-\\nties (described later). We examine the cardinality of relationships next.\\nCardinalities in Relationships\\nSuppose there are two entity types, A and B, connected by a relationship. The cardinality \\nof a relationship (see the fifth, seventh, and eighth questions in Table 8-1) is the \\nnumber of instances of entity B that can (or must) be associated with each instance \\nof entity A. For example, consider the relationship for DVDs at a video store shown \\nin Figure 8-13a.\\nClearly, a video store may stock more than one DVD of a given movie. In the ter-\\nminology we have used so far, this example is intuitively a “many” relationship. Yet it \\nis also true that the store may not have a single copy of a particular movie in stock. We \\nneed a more precise notation to indicate the range of cardinalities for a relationship. \\nThis notation was introduced in Figure 8-5, which you may want to review at this point.\\nMinimum and Maximum Cardinalities  The minimum cardinality of a relation-\\nship is the minimum number of instances of entity B that may be associated with \\neach instance of entity A. In the preceding example, the minimum number of DVDs \\navailable for a movie is zero, in which case we say that DVD is an optional participant \\nin the Is_stocked_as relationship. When the minimum cardinality of a relationship \\nis one, then we say that entity B is a mandatory participant in the relationship. The \\nmaximum cardinality is the maximum number of instances. For our example, this \\nmaximum is “many” (an unspecified number greater than one). Using the notation \\nfrom Figure 8-5, we diagram this relationship in Figure 8-13b. The zero through the \\nline near the DVD entity means a minimum cardinality of zero, whereas the crow’s \\nfoot notation means a “many” maximum cardinality. The double underline of Copy_\\nNumber indicates that this attribute is part of the identifier of DVD, but the full com-\\nposite identifier must also include the identifier of MOVIE, Movie_Name.\\nExamples of three relationships that show all possible combinations of mini-\\nmum and maximum cardinalities appear in Figure 8-14. A brief description of each \\nrelationship follows:\\n1. PATIENT Has_recorded PATIENT_HISTORY (Figure 8-14a). Each patient has \\nrecorded one or more patient histories (we assume that the initial patient visit \\nis always recorded as an instance of PATIENT HISTORY). Each instance of \\nPATIENT HISTORY is a record for exactly one PATIENT.\\nCardinality\\nThe number of instances of entity B that can \\n(or must) be associated with each instance \\nof entity A.\\nFigure 8-13 \\nIntroducing cardinality constraints\\n(a) Basic relationship\\n(b) Relationship with cardinality \\nconstraints\\nIs_stocked_as\\nDVDMOVIE\\n(a)\\nIs_stocked_asMOVIE\\nMovie_Name\\nDVD\\nCopy_Number\\n(b)'),\n",

EMPLOYEE Is_assigned_to PROJECT (Figure 8-14b). Each PROJECT has at least \\none assigned EMPLOYEE (some projects have more than one). Each EMPLOYEE \\nmay or (optionally) may not be assigned to any existing PROJECT, or may be as-\\nsigned to several PROJECTs.\\n3. PERSON Is_married_to PERSON (Figure 8-14c). This is an optional zero or one \\ncardinality in both directions because a person may or may not be married.\\nIt is possible for the maximum cardinality to be a fixed number, not an arbitrary \\n“many” value. For example, suppose corporate policy states that an employee may \\nwork on at most five projects at the same time. We could show this business rule by plac-\\ning a “5” above or below the crow’s foot next to the PROJECT entity in Figure 8-14b.\\nnaming and Defining Relationships\\nRelationships may be the most difficult component of an E-R diagram to understand. \\nThus, you should use a few special guidelines for naming relationships, such as the \\nfollowing:\\n•\\t A relationship name is a verb phrase (such as Assigned_to, Supplies, or Teaches). \\nRelationships represent actions, usually in the present tense. A relationship name \\nstates the action taken, not the result of the action (e.g., use Assigned_to, not \\nAssignment).\\n•\\t You should avoid vague names, such as Has or Is_related_to. Use descriptive verb \\nphrases taken from the action verbs found in the definition of the relationship.\\nSpecific guidelines for defining relationships follow:\\n•\\t A relationship definition explains what action is being taken and possibly why it is \\n important. It may be important to state who or what does the action, but it is not \\nimportant to explain how the action is taken.\\n•\\t It may be important to give examples to clarify the action. For example, for a \\n relationship Registered_for between student and course, it may be useful to \\n explain that this covers both on-site and online registration and registrations made  \\nduring the drop/add period.\\nMark\\nSarah\\nElsie\\nVisit 1\\nVisit 1\\nVisit 1\\nVisit 2\\nPATIENT PATIENT\\nHISTORY\\nHas recorded\\n(a) Figure 8-14 \\nExamples of cardinality constraints\\n(a) Mandatory cardinalities\\n(b) One optional, one mandatory \\ncardinality\\n(c) Optional cardinalities\\nRose\\nPete\\nDebbie\\nTom\\nHeidi\\nBPR\\nTQM\\nOO\\nCR\\nEMPLOYEE\\nIs_assigned_to\\nPROJECT\\n(b)\\nShirley\\nMack\\nDawn\\nKathy\\nEllis\\nFred\\nPERSON\\nIs_married_to(c)'),\n",

You should explain what \\nconditions lead to zero associated instances, whether this can happen only when \\nan entity instance is first created or whether this can happen at any time.\\n•\\t A relationship definition should also explain the reason for any explicit maximum \\ncardinality other than many.\\n•\\t A relationship definition should explain any restrictions on participation in the relation-\\nship. For example, “Supervised_by links an employee with the other employees he \\nor she supervises and links an employee with the other employee who supervises \\nhim or her. An employee cannot supervise him- or herself, and an employee can-\\nnot supervise other employees if his or her job classification level is below 4.”\\n•\\t A relationship definition should explain the extent of history that is kept in the relationship.\\n•\\t A relationship definition should explain whether an entity instance involved in a \\nrelationship instance can transfer participation to another relationship instance. For \\nexample, “Places links a customer with the orders they have placed with our com-\\npany. An order is not transferable to another customer.”\\nassociative entities\\nAs seen in the examples of the Supplies relationship in Figure 8-11 and the Has_ \\ncomponents relationship of Figure 8-12, attributes may be associated with a many-to-\\nmany relationship as well as with an entity.

Often the distinction between entity and \\nrelationship is simply a matter of how you view the data. An associative entity (some-\\ntimes called a gerund) is a relationship that the data modeler chooses to model as an \\nentity type. Figure 8-15b shows the E-R notation for representing the Completes rela-\\ntionship as an associative entity and Figure 8-15c shows how this would be modeled \\nusing Microsoft Visio. The lines from CERTIFICATE to the two entities are not two \\nseparate binary relationships, so they do not have labels. Note that EMPLOYEE and \\nCOURSE have mandatory one cardinality because an instance of Completes must \\nhave an associated EMPLOYEE and COURSE. The labels A and B show where the \\ncardinalities from the Completes relation now appear. We have created an identifier \\nfor CERTIFICATE of Certificate_Number, rather than use the implied combination \\nof the identifiers of EMPLOYEE and COURSE, Employee_ID and Course_Name, \\nrespectively.\\nAn example of the use of an associative entity for a ternary relationship appears \\nin Figure 8-16. This figure shows an alternative (and more explicit) representation \\nof the ternary Supplies relationship shown in Figure 8-11. In Figure 8-16, the  entity \\ntype (associative entity) SHIPMENT SCHEDULE replaces the Supplies relation-\\nship from Figure 8-11. Each instance of SHIPMENT SCHEDULE represents a real-\\nworld shipment by a given vendor of a particular part to a selected warehouse. The \\nShipment_Mode and Unit_Cost are attributes of SHIPMENT SCHEDULE. We have \\nnot designated an identifier for SHIPMENT SCHEDULE, so implicitly it would be\\xa0a \\ncomposite identifier of the identifiers of the three related entities. Business rules \\nabout participation of vendors, parts, and warehouses in supplies relationships are \\nshown via the cardinalities next to SUPPLY SCHEDULE. Remember, as with any asso-\\nciative identity, these are not three separate relationships.\\nOne situation in which a relationship must be turned into an associative entity is \\nwhen the associative entity has other relationships with entities besides the relation-\\nship that caused its creation. For example, consider the E-R diagram in Figure 8-17a \\nthat represents price quotes from different vendors for purchased parts stocked \\nby PVF. Now, suppose that we also need to know which price quote is in effect for \\neach part shipment received. This additional data requirement necessitates that the \\nQuotes_price relationship be transformed into an associative entity, as shown in \\nFigure 8-17b.\\nAssociative entity\\nAn entity type that associates the \\ninstances of one or more entity types and \\ncontains attributes that are peculiar to the \\nrelationship between those entity Instances; \\nalso called a gerund.\\nEach vendor can supply many\\nparts to any number of ware-\\nhouses, but need not supply\\nany parts.\\nEach part can be supplied by\\nany number of vendors to \\nmore than one warehouse, but\\neach part must be supplied by\\nat least one vendor to a\\nwarehouse.\\nEach warehouse can be \\nsupplied with any number of\\nparts from more than one\\nvendor, but each warehouse\\nmust be supplied with at least\\none part.\\nBusiness Rules\\n1\\n2\\n3\\nPART\\nVENDOR\\nSUPPLY SCHEDULE\\nShipping_Mode\\nUnit_Cost\\nWAREHOUSE\\n31\\n2\\nFigure 8-16 \\nCardinality constraints in a ternary relationship'),\n",

Rather, PRICE QUOTE \\nis a binary many-to-many relationship (associative entity) between VENDOR and \\nPART. In addition, each PART RECEIPT, based on Amount, has an applicable, nego-\\ntiated Price. Each PART RECEIPT is for a given PART from a specific VENDOR, and \\nthe Amount of the receipt dictates the purchase price in effect by matching with the \\nQuantity attribute. Because the PRICE QUOTE pertains to a given PART and a given \\nVENDOR, PART RECEIPT does not need direct relationships with these entities.\\nSummary of Conceptual Data Modeling with e-R Diagrams\\nThe purpose of E-R diagramming is to capture the richest possible understanding \\nof the meaning of data necessary for an information system or organization. Besides \\nthe aspects shown in this chapter, there are many other semantics about data that E-R \\n diagramming can represent. Some of these more advanced capabilities are  explained \\nin Hoffer et al. (2016). You can also find some general guidelines for effective con-\\nceptual data modeling in Hoberman et al. (2012). The following section presents \\none final aspect of conceptual data modeling: capturing the relationship between \\nsimilar entity types.\\nRepReSenting SupeRtypeS anD SubtypeS\\nOften two or more entity types seem very similar (maybe they have almost the same \\nname), but there are a few differences. That is, these entity types share common \\nproperties but also have one or more distinct attributes or relationships. To address \\nthis situation, the E-R model has been extended to include supertype/subtype rela-\\ntionships. A subtype is a subgrouping of the entities in an entity type that is mean-\\ningful to the organization. For example, STUDENT is an entity type in a university. \\nTwo subtypes of STUDENT are GRADUATE STUDENT and UNDERGRADUATE \\nSTUDENT. A supertype is a generic entity type that has a relationship with one or \\nmore subtypes.\\nSubtype\\nA subgrouping of the entities in an \\nentity type that is meaningful to the \\norganization and that shares common \\nattributes or relationships distinct from other \\nsubgroupings.\\nSupertype\\nA generic entity type that has a relationship \\nwith one or more subtypes.\\nPART\\nQuantity\\nPrice\\nVENDOR\\nPART\\nPART RECEIPT\\nOrder_Number\\nDate\\nAmount\\nVENDOR\\nPRICE QUOTE\\nQuantity\\nPrice\\nPriced_at\\n(a)\\n(b)\\nFigure 8-17 \\nSituation requiring an associative entity\\n(a) Many-to-many relationship with \\nattributes\\n(b) Associative entity with separate \\nrelationship'),\n",

The supertype PATIENT is connected with a line to a \\ncircle, which in turn is connected by a line to each of the two subtypes, OUTPATIENT \\nand RESIDENT PATIENT. Attributes that are shared by all patients (including the \\nidentifier) are associated with the supertype; attributes that are unique to a particular \\nsubtype (e.g., Checkback_Date for OUTPATIENT) are associated with that subtype. \\nRelationships in which all types of patients participate (Is_cared_for) are associated \\nwith the supertype; relationships in which only a subtype participates (Is_assigned for \\nRESIDENT PATIENTs) are associated only with the relevant subtype.\\nSeveral important business rules govern supertype/subtype relationships. The \\ntotal specialization rule specifies that each entity instance of the supertype must be a \\nmember of some subtype in the relationship. The partial specialization rule specifies \\nthat an entity instance of the supertype does not have to belong to any subtype. Total \\nspecialization is shown on an E-R diagram by a double line from the supertype to \\nthe circle, and partial specialization is shown by a single line. The disjoint rule speci-\\nfies that if an entity instance of the supertype is a member of one subtype, it cannot \\nsimultaneously be a member of any other subtype. The overlap rule specifies that an \\nentity instance can simultaneously be a member of two (or more) subtypes. Disjoint \\nversus overlap is shown by a “d” or an “o” in the circle.\\nFigure 8-19 illustrates several combinations of these rules for a hierarchy of \\nsupertypes and subtypes in a university database. In this example\\n•\\t a PERSON must be (total specialization) an EMPLOYEE, an ALUMNUS, or a \\nSTUDENT, or any combination of these subtypes (overlap);\\n•\\t an EMPLOYEE must be a FACULTY or a STAFF (disjoint), or may be just an \\nEMPLOYEE (partial specialization); and\\n•\\t a STUDENT can be only a GRADUATE STUDENT or an UNDERGRADUATE \\nSTUDENT and nothing else (total specialization and disjoint).\\nbuSineSS RuleS\\nConceptual data modeling is a step-by-step process for documenting information re-\\nquirements, and it is concerned with both the structure of data and with rules about \\nthe integrity of those data (see the eighth question in Table 8-1). Business rules are \\nspecifications that preserve the integrity of the logical data model. Four basic types of \\nbusiness rules are as follows:\\n1. Entity integrity. Each instance of an entity type must have a unique identifier that \\nis not null.\\nTotal specialization rule\\nSpecifies that each entity instance of the \\nsupertype must be a member of some \\nsubtype of the relationship.\\nPartial specialization rule\\nSpecifies that an entity instance of the \\nsupertype does not have to belong to any \\nsubtype.\\nDisjoint rule\\nSpecifies that if an entity instance of the \\nsupertype is a member of one subtype, it \\ncannot simultaneously be a member of any \\nother subtype.\\nOverlap rule\\nSpecifies that an entity instance can \\nsimultaneously be a member of two (or \\nmore) subtypes.\\nBusiness rules\\nSpecifications that preserve the integrity \\nof\\xa0the logical data model.\\nCheckback_Date\\nOUTPATIENT RESIDENT\\nPATIENT\\nDate_Discharged\\nIs_cared_for\\nIs_assigned\\nBED\\nBed_ID\\nPATIENT\\nPatient_ID\\nPatient_Name\\nAdmit_Date\\nRESPONSIBLE\\nPHYSICIAN\\nPhysician_ID\\nFigure 8-18 \\nSupertype/subtype relationships  \\nin a hospital'),\n",

Other business rules that protect the validity of attribute \\nvalues.\\nThe E-R model that we have described in this chapter is concerned primarily \\nwith the structure of data rather than with expressing business rules (although some \\nelementary rules are implied in the E-R model). Generally, the business rules are cap-\\ntured during requirements determination and stored in the CASE repository as they \\nare documented. Entity integrity was described earlier in this chapter, and referential \\nintegrity is described in Chapter 9 because it applies to database design. In this sec-\\ntion, we briefly describe two types of rules: domains and triggering operations. These \\nrules are illustrated with a simple example from a banking environment, shown in \\nFigure 8-20a. In this example, an ACCOUNT entity has a relationship (Is_for) with a \\nWITHDRAWAL entity.\\nDomains\\nA domain is the set of all data types and ranges of values that attributes may assume \\n(Hoffer et al., 2016). Domain definitions typically specify some (or all) of the follow-\\ning characteristics of attributes: data type, length, format, range, allowable values, \\nmeaning, uniqueness, and null support (whether an attribute value may or may not \\nbe null).\\nFigure 8-20b shows two domain definitions for the banking example. The first \\ndefinition is for Account_Number. Because Account_Number is an identifier attri-\\nbute, the definition specifies that Account_Number must be unique and must not be \\nDomain\\nThe set of all data types and values that an \\nattribute can assume.\\nPERSON\\nSSN\\nName\\nAddress\\nGender\\nDate_of_Birth\\nALUMNUS\\n{Degree(Year,\\nDesignation,\\nDate)}\\nContract_Number\\nBilling_Rate\\nSalary\\nDate_Hired\\nEMPLOYEE STUDENT\\nMajor_Dept\\nSTAFF\\nPositionRank\\nFACULTY UNDERGRAD\\nSTUDENT\\nClass_StandingTest_Score\\nGRADUATE\\nSTUDENT\\ndd\\nO\\nFigure 8-19 \\nExample of supertype/subtype hierarchy'),\n",

The definition specifies that the \\nattribute data type is character and that the format is nnn-nnnn. Thus, any attempt to \\nenter a value for this attribute that does not conform to its character type or format \\nwill be rejected, and an error message will be displayed.\\nThe domain definition for the Amount attribute (dollar amount of the \\nrequested withdrawal) also may not be null, but is not unique. The format allows for \\ntwo decimal places to accommodate a currency field. The range of values has a lower \\nlimit of zero (to prevent negative values) and an upper limit of 10,000. The latter is \\nan arbitrary upper limit for a single withdrawal transaction.\\nThe use of domains offers several advantages:\\n•\\t Domains verify that the values for an attribute (stored by insert or update opera-\\ntions) are valid.\\n•\\t Domains ensure that various data manipulation operations (such as joins or \\nunions in a relational database system) are logical.\\n•\\t Domains help conserve effort in describing attribute characteristics.\\nDomains can conserve effort because we can define domains and then associate \\neach attribute in the data model with an appropriate domain.

Having defined the domain Account_\\nNumber once (as shown in Figure 8-13b), we simply associate each of these three \\nattributes with Account_Number.

The \\nscope of triggering operations may be limited to attributes within one entity or it may \\nextend to attributes in two or more entities. Complex business rules may often be \\nstated as triggering operations.\\nA triggering operation normally includes the following components:\\n1. User rule. A concise statement of the business rule to be enforced by the trigger -\\ning operation.\\n2. Event. The data manipulation operation (insert, delete, or update) that initiates \\nthe operation.\\n3. Entity name. The name of the entity being accessed and/or modified.\\n4. Condition. The condition that causes the operation to be triggered.\\n5. Action. The action taken when the operation is triggered.\\nFigure 8-20c shows an example of a triggering operation for the banking situation. \\nThe business rule is a simple (and familiar) one: the amount of an attempted with-\\ndrawal may not exceed the current account balance. The event of interest is an \\nattempted insert of an instance of the WITHDRAWAL entity type (perhaps from an \\nautomated teller machine). The condition is\\nAmount (of the withdrawal). ACCOUNT Balance\\nWhen this condition is triggered, the action taken is to reject the transaction. You \\nshould note two things about this triggering operation: first, it spans two entity types; \\nsecond, the business rule could not be enforced through the use of domains.\\nThe use of triggering operations is an increasingly important component of \\ndatabase strategy. With triggering operations, the responsibility for data integrity lies \\nwithin the scope of the database management system rather than with application \\nprograms or human operators. In the banking example, tellers could conceivably \\ncheck the account balance before processing each withdrawal. Human  operators \\nwould be subject to human error and, in any event, manual processing would not \\nwork with automated teller machines. Alternatively, the logic of integrity checks \\ncould be built into the appropriate application programs, but integrity checks would \\nrequire duplicating the logic in each program. There is no assurance that the logic \\nwould be consistent (because the application programs may have been developed at \\ndifferent times by different people) or that the application programs will be kept up \\nto date as conditions change.\\nAs stated earlier, business rules should be documented in the CASE reposi-\\ntory. Ideally, these rules will then be checked automatically by database software. \\nRemoving business rules from application programs and incorporating them in the \\nrepository (in the form of domains, referential integrity constraints, and triggering \\noperations) has several important advantages; specifically, incorporating business \\nrules in the repository\\n1. provides for faster application development with fewer errors because these \\nrules can be generated into programs or enforced by the database management \\nsystem,\\n2. reduces maintenance effort and expenditures,\\n3. provides for faster response to business changes,\\n4. facilitates end-user involvement in developing new systems and manipulating \\ndata,\\n5. provides for consistent application of integrity constraints,\\n6. reduces the time and effort required to train application programmers, and\\n7. promotes ease of use of a database.\\nFor a more thorough treatment of business rules, see Hoffer et al.

Instead, common database patterns for different business situations are avail-\\nable in packaged data models (or model components) that can be purchased at com-\\nparatively low cost and, after suitable customization, assembled into full-scale data \\nmodels. These generic data models are developed by industry specialists, consultants, \\nand database technology vendors based on their expertise and experience in dozens \\nof organizations across multiple industry types. The models are typically provided as \\nthe contents of a data modeling software package, such as ERWin from Computer \\nAssociates. The software is able to produce E-R diagrams, maintain all metadata about \\nthe data model, and produce a variety of reports that help in the process of tailoring \\nthe data model to the specific situation, such as customizing data names, changing \\nrelationship characteristics, or adding data unique to your environment. The software \\ncan then generate the computer code to define the database to a database manage-\\nment system once the design is fully customized to the local situation. Some simple \\nand limited generic data models can be found in books or on the Internet.\\nThere are two principal types of packaged data models: universal data models \\napplicable to nearly any business or organization and industry-specific data models. \\nWe discuss each of these types briefly and provide references for each type.\\nuniversal Data Models\\nNumerous core subject areas are common to many (or even most) organizations, \\nsuch as customers, products, accounts, documents, and projects. Although they \\n differ in detail, the underlying data structures are often quite similar for these sub-\\njects. Further, there are core business functions such as purchasing, accounting, \\n receiving, and project management that follow common patterns. Universal data \\nmodels are templates for one or more of these subject areas and/or functions. All of \\nthe  expected components of data models are generally included: entities, relation-\\nships, attributes, primary and foreign keys, and even sample data. Two examples of \\nuniversal data model sets are provided by Hoberman (2009), Marco and Jennings \\n(2004), and Silverston and Agnew (2008).\\nindustry-Specific Data Models\\nIndustry-specific data models are generic data models that are designed to be used \\nby organizations within specific industries. Data models are available for nearly every \\nmajor industry group, including health care, telecommunications, discrete manu-\\nfacturing, process manufacturing, banking, insurance, and higher education. These \\nmodels are based on the premise that data model patterns for organizations are very \\nsimilar within a particular industry (“a bank is a bank”). However, the data models \\nfor one industry (such as banking) are quite different from those for another (such \\nas hospitals). Prominent examples of industry-specific data models are provided by \\nInmon (2005), Kimball and Ross (2013), and Silverston and Agnew (2008).\\nbenefits of Database patterns and packaged Data Models\\nMost people in the data modeling field refer to a purchased universal or industry-\\nspecific database pattern as a logical data model (LDM). Technically, the term logical \\ndata model means a conceptual data model with some additional properties associ-\\nated with the most popular type of database technology—relational databases. The \\ntype of data planning and analysis we have covered in this chapter can, in fact, be '),\n",

The process is the same; only \\nthe starting point is different.\\nLDMs are the database version of patterns, components, and prepackaged \\napplications that have been discussed in prior chapters as ways to more quickly and \\nreliably build a new application. An advantage of LDMs is that a packaged data model \\nnow exists for almost every industry and application area, for specific operational \\nsystems to enterprise systems, such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and data \\nwarehouses. They are available from database software vendors, application software \\nproviders, and consulting firms. The use of a prepackaged data model does not elim-\\ninate the need for the methods and techniques we discuss in this chapter; they only \\nchange the context in which these methods and techniques are used.\\nIt is now important that you consider purchasing a prepackaged data model \\neven when an application is to be built from scratch. Consider the following benefits \\nof starting with and then tailoring a purchased data model:\\n•\\t Validated. Purchased models are proven through extensive experience.\\n•\\t Cost reduction. Projects with purchased models take less time and cost less be-\\ncause the initial discovery steps are no longer necessary, leaving only iterative \\ntailoring and refinement to the local situation.\\n•\\t Anticipate future requirements, not just initial requirements. Purchased models antici-\\npate future needs, not just those recognized during the first version of an appli-\\ncation. Thus, because the database structure does not require structural change \\n(which can have costly ramifications for reprogramming the applications using \\nthe database), their benefits are recurring, not one-time.\\n•\\t Facilitates systems analysis. The purchased model actually facilitates database plan-\\nning and analysis by providing a first data model, which you can use to generate \\nspecific analysis questions and concrete, not hypothetical or abstract, examples of \\nwhat might be in the appropriate database.\\n•\\t Consistent and complete. The purchased data models are very general, covering \\nalmost all options employed by the associated functional area or industry. Thus, \\nthey provide a structure that, when tailored, will be consistent and complete.\\nSee Hoffer et al. (2016) for more details on the use of packaged data models in \\ndata modeling and database development. Of course, packaged data models are no \\nsubstitute for sound database analysis and design. Skilled analysts and designers are \\nstill necessary to determine database requirements and to select, modify, install, and \\nintegrate any packaged systems that are used.\\neleCtRoniC CoMMeRCe appliCation: \\nConCeptual Data MoDeling\\nConceptual data modeling for an Internet-based electronic commerce application is \\nno different than the process followed when analyzing the data needs for other types \\nof applications.

Finally, Jim examined the data flows from \\nthe DFD as additional possible sources for entities. This analysis resulted in the iden-\\ntification of five general categories of information that he needed to consider:\\n•\\t Customer\\n•\\t Inventory\\n•\\t Order\\n•\\t Shopping Cart\\n•\\t Temporary User/System Messages\\nAfter identifying these multiple categories of data, Jim’s next step was to care-\\nfully define each item. To do this, he again examined all data flows within the DFD \\nand recorded the source and destination of all data flows. By carefully listing these \\nflows, he could more easily move through the DFD and more thoroughly understand \\nwhat information was needed to move from point to point. This activity resulted \\nin the creation of two tables that documented his growing understanding of the \\nWebStore’s requirements. The first, Table 8-3, lists each of the data flows within each \\ndata category and its corresponding description. The second, Table 8-4, lists each of \\nthe unique data flows within each data category. He now felt ready to construct an \\nE-R diagram for the WebStore.\\nJim concluded that Customer, Inventory, and Order were each a unique entity \\nand would be part of his E-R diagram.

We \\noutlined the structuring of conceptual data models using \\nthe E-R notation and discussed how the components of a \\nconceptual data model relate to data flows and data stores.\\nConceptual data modeling is based on certain \\nconstructs about the structure, not use, of data. These \\n constructs include entity, relationship, degree, and car-\\ndinality. A data model shows the relatively permanent \\nbusiness rules that define the nature of an organization. \\nRules define characteristics of data such as the legitimate \\ndomain of values for data attributes, the unique character-\\nistics (identifier) of entities, the relationships between dif-\\nferent entities, and the triggering operations that protect \\nthe validity of attributes during data maintenance.\\nA data model shows major categories of data, called \\nentities for the E-R notation; the associations or relation-\\nships between entities; and the attributes of both entities \\nand relationships. A special type of entity called an associa-\\ntive entity is often necessary to represent a many-to-many \\nrelationship between entities. Entity types are distinct from \\nentity instances. Each entity instance is distinguished from \\nother instances of the same type by an identifier attribute.\\nRelationships are the glue that holds a data model \\ntogether. Three common relationship types are unary, bi-\\nnary, and ternary. The minimum and maximum number of \\nentity instances that participate in a relationship represent \\nimportant rules about the nature of the organization, as \\ncaptured during requirements determination. Supertype/\\nsubtype relationships can be used to show a hierarchy of \\nmore-general to more-specific related entity types that \\nshare common attributes and relationships. Rules for total \\nand partial specialization between the supertype and sub-\\ntypes and disjoint and overlap among the subtypes clarify \\nthe meaning of the related entity types.\\nModern systems analysis is based on reuse, and one \\nform of reuse is prepackaged conceptual data models. \\nThese data models can be purchased from various vendors \\nand are very helpful in learning best practices from other \\norganizations in the same industry or for the same busi-\\nness function. They save considerable time over building \\ncomplex data models from scratch.\\nKey TermS\\n  8.1 Associative entity\\n  8.2 Attribute\\n  8.3 Binary relationship\\n  8.4 Business rules\\n  8.5 Candidate key\\n  8.6 Cardinality\\n  8.7 Composite attribute\\n  8.8 Conceptual data model\\n  8.9 Degree\\n 8.10 Derived attribute\\n 8.11 Disjoint rule\\n 8.12 Domain'),\n",

We describe \\nthe main concepts and techniques involved in object \\nmodeling, including objects and classes, encapsulation \\nof attributes and operations, aggregation relationships, \\npolymorphism, and inheritance. We show how you can \\ndevelop class diagrams, using the UML notation, to pro-\\nvide a conceptual view of the system being modeled. \\nFor a more thorough coverage of object modeling, see \\nGeorge et al. (2007).\\nRepReSenting objeCtS anD \\nClaSSeS\\nWith the object-oriented approach, we model the world \\nin objects. Before applying this approach to a real-world \\nproblem, we need to understand what an object really is. \\nSimilar to an entity instance, an object has a well-defined \\nrole in the application domain, and it has state (data), be-\\nhavior, and identity characteristics. An object is a single \\noccurrence of a class, which we define below.\\nAn object has a state and exhibits behavior through \\noperations that can examine or affect its state. The state of \\nan object encompasses its properties (attributes and rela-\\ntionships) and the values of those properties. Its  behavior \\nrepresents how an object acts and reacts (Booch et al., \\n2007). An object’s state is determined by its attribute values \\nand links to other objects. An object’s behavior depends on \\nits state and the operation being performed. An operation \\nis simply an action that one object performs upon another \\nin order to get a response. You can think of an operation \\nas a service provided by an object (supplier) to its clients. \\nA client sends a message to a supplier, which delivers the \\ndesired service by executing the corresponding operation.\\nConsider the example of a student, Mary Jones,  \\nrepresented as an object. The state of this object is charac-\\nterized by its attributes (name, date of birth, year,  address, \\nand phone number) and the values these attributes \\n currently have; for example, name is “Mary Jones,” year \\nis “junior,” and so on. Its behavior is expressed through \\noperations such as calc-gpa, which is used to calculate a \\nstudent’s current grade point average. The Mary Jones \\nobject, therefore, packages both its state and its behavior \\ntogether.\\nAll objects have an identity; that is, no two objects are \\nthe same. For example, if there are two Student instances \\nwith the same name and date of birth (or even all attri-\\nbutes), they are essentially two different objects. An ob-\\nject maintains its own identity over its life. For example, if \\nMary Jones gets married and changes her name, address, \\nand phone, she will still be represented by the same ob-\\nject. This concept of an inherent identity is different from \\nthe identifier concept we saw earlier for E-R modeling.\\nWe use the term object class (or simply class) to refer \\nto a logical grouping of objects that have the same (or simi-\\nlar) attributes, relationships, and behaviors (methods) (just \\nas we used entity type and entity instance earlier in this '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\ASUS\\\\Desktop\\\\AI powered chatbot\\\\Data\\\\SAD.pdf', 'page': 315}, page_content=' ChaPter 8   structuring system DAtA requirements 291\\nchapter). In our example, therefore, Mary Jones is an object instance, whereas Student \\nis an object class (as Student was an entity type in E-R diagramming).\\nClasses can be depicted graphically in a class diagram, as shown in Figure 8-26. \\nA class diagram shows the static structure of an object-oriented model: the object \\nclasses, their internal structure, and the relationships in which they participate. In \\nUML, a class is represented by a rectangle with three compartments separated by \\nhorizontal lines. The class name appears in the top compartment, the list of attri-\\nbutes in the middle compartment, and the list of operations in the bottom compart-\\nment of the rectangle. The diagram in Figure 8-26 shows two classes, Student and \\nCourse, along with their attributes and operations.\\nThe Student class is a group of Student objects that share a common structure \\nand a common behavior. Each object knows to which class it belongs; for example, \\nthe Mary Jones object knows that it belongs to the Student class. Objects belonging \\nto the same class may also participate in similar relationships with other objects; for \\nexample, all students register for courses and, therefore, the Student class can par-\\nticipate in a relationship called “registers-for” with another class called Course (see \\nthe section Representing Associations).\\nAn operation, such as calc-gpa in Student (see Figure 8-26), is a function or a \\nservice that is provided by all the instances of a class to invoke behavior in an object \\nby passing a message. It is only through such operations that other objects can ac-\\ncess or manipulate the information stored in an object. The operations, therefore, \\nprovide an external interface to a class; the interface presents the outside view of the \\nclass without showing its internal structure or how its operations are implemented. \\nThis technique of hiding the internal implementation details of an object from its \\nexternal view is known as encapsulation, or information hiding (Booch et al., 2007; \\nRumbaugh et al., 1991). So while we provide the abstraction of the behavior com-\\nmon to all instances of a class in its interface, we encapsulate within the class its struc-\\nture and the secrets of the desired behavior.\\ntypeS of opeRationS\\nOperations can be classified into three types, depending on the kind of service \\nrequested by clients: (1) constructor, (2) query, and (3) update (Bell, 2004). A \\n constructor operation creates a new instance of a class. For example, you can have an \\noperation called create-student within Student that creates a new student and initial-\\nizes its state. Such constructor operations are available to all classes and, therefore, \\nare not explicitly shown in the class diagram.\\nA query operation is an operation that does not have any side effects; it ac-\\ncesses the state of an object but does not alter the state (Fowler, 2003; Rumbaugh \\net al., 1991). For example, the Student class can have an operation called get-year \\n(not shown) that simply retrieves the year (freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior) \\nof the Student object specified in the query. Note that there is no need to show \\nexplicitly a query such as get-year in the class diagram because it retrieves the value \\nClass diagram\\nShows the static structure of an object-\\noriented model: the object classes, their \\ninternal structure, and the relationships in \\nwhich they participate.\\nOperation\\nA function or a service that is provided by \\nall the instances of a class.\\nencapsulation\\nThe technique of hiding the internal \\nimplementation details of an object from its \\nexternal view.\\nConstructor operation\\nAn operation that creates a new instance \\nof a class.\\nQuery operation\\nAn operation that accesses the state of an \\nobject but does not alter the state.\\nname\\ndateOfBirth\\nyear\\naddress\\nphone\\ncalc-age (  )\\ncalc-gpa (  )\\nregister-for (course)\\nStudent\\ncrse-code\\ncrse-title\\ncredit-hrs\\nenrollment (  )\\nCourseClass \\nname\\nList of\\nattributes\\nList of\\noperations\\nFigure 8-26 \\nUML class diagram showing two classes\\nState\\nEncompasses an object’s properties \\n(attributes and relationships) and the values \\nof those properties.\\nObject\\nAn entity that has a well-defined role in \\nthe application domain, and it has state, \\nbehavior, and identity characteristics.\\nBehavior\\nRepresents how an object acts and reacts.\\nObject class\\nA logical grouping of objects that have the \\nsame (or similar) attributes, relationships, \\nand behaviors; also called class.'),\n",

Consider, however, the calc-age operation within \\nStudent. This is also a query operation because it does not have any side effects. Note \\nthat the only argument for this query is the target Student object. Such a query can \\nbe represented as a derived attribute (Rumbaugh et al., 1991); for example, we can \\nrepresent “age” as a derived attribute of Student. Because the target object is always \\nan implicit argument of an operation, there is no need to show it explicitly in the \\noperation declaration.\\nAn update operation has side effects; it alters the state of an object. For exam-\\nple, consider an operation of Student called promote-student (not shown). The op-\\neration promotes a student to a new year, say, from junior to senior, thereby changing \\nthe Student object’s state (value of the year attribute). Another example of an update \\noperation is register-for(course), which, when invoked, has the effect of establishing \\na connection from a Student object to a specific Course object. Note that, in addition \\nto having the target Student object as an implicit argument, the operation has an ex-\\nplicit argument called “course” that specifies the course for which the student wants \\nto register. Explicit arguments are shown within parentheses.\\nA class-scope operation is an operation that applies to a class rather than an \\nobject instance. For example, avg-gpa for the Student class (not shown with the other \\noperations for this class in Figure 8-26) calculates the average GPA across all students \\n(the operation name is underlined to indicate that it is a scope operation).\\nRepReSenting aSSoCiationS\\nParallel to the definition of a relationship for the E-R model, an association is a \\nrelationship among instances of object classes. As in the E-R model, the degree of an \\nassociation relationship may be one (unary), two (binary), three (ternary), or higher \\n(n-ary). In Figure 8-27, we illustrate how the object-oriented model can be used to \\nrepresent association relationships of different degrees. An association is shown as \\na solid line between the participating classes. The name given to the end of an \\nassociation where it connects to a class is called an association role (Bell, 2004). Each \\nassociation has two or more roles. A role may be explicitly named with a label near \\nthe end of an association (see the “manager” role in Figure 8-27). The role name in-\\ndicates the role played by the class attached to the end near which the name appears. \\nUse of role names is optional. You can specify role names in place of or in addition to \\nan association name. You may show the direction of an association explicitly by using \\na solid triangle next to the association name.\\nFigure 8-27 shows two unary relationships, Is-married-to and Manages. At one \\nend of the Manages relationship, we have named the role as “manager,” implying \\nthat an employee can play the role of a manager. We have not named the other roles, \\nbut we have named the associations. When the role name does not appear, you may \\nthink of the role name as being that of the class attached to that end (Fowler, 2003). \\nFor example, you may call the role for the right end of the Is-assigned relationship in \\nFigure 8-27 “Parking Place.”\\nEach role has a multiplicity, which indicates how many objects participate in \\na given association relationship. For example, a multiplicity of 2..5 denotes that a \\nminimum of two and a maximum of five objects can participate in a given relation-\\nship. Multiplicities, therefore, are nothing but cardinality constraints, which you saw \\nin E-R diagrams. In addition to integer values, the upper bound of a multiplicity can \\nbe an * (asterisk), which denotes an infinite upper bound. If a single integer value is \\nspecified, it means that the range includes only that value.\\nThe multiplicities for both roles in the Is-married-to relationship in Figure 8-27 \\nare 0..1, indicating that a person may be single or married to one person. The multi-\\nplicity for the manager role in the Manages relationship is 0..1 and that for the other \\nrole is 0..*, implying that an employee may be managed by only one manager, but a \\nmanager may manage zero to many employees.\\nupdate operation\\nAn operation that alters the state of an \\nobject.\\nClass-scope operation\\nAn operation that applies to a class rather \\nthan an object instance.\\nAssociation\\nA named relationship between or among \\nobject classes.\\nAssociation role\\nThe end of an association where it \\nconnects to a class.\\nMultiplicity\\nA specification that indicates how many \\nobjects participate in a given relationship.'),\n",

As is preferred in an E-R diagram, we represent a ternary rela-\\ntionship using a class and place the name of the relationship there.\\nThe class diagram in Figure 8-28 shows several binary associations. The diagram \\nshows that a student may have an adviser, while a faculty member may advise up to a \\nmaximum of 10 students. Also, while a course may have multiple offerings, a given \\ncourse offering is scheduled for exactly one course. UML allows you to specify nu-\\nmerically any multiplicity. For example, the diagram shows that a course offering may \\nbe taught by one or two instructors (1,2). You can specify a single number (e.g., 2 for \\nthe members of a bridge team), a range (e.g., 11–14 for the players of a soccer team \\nwho participated in a particular game), or a discrete set of numbers and ranges (e.g., \\n3, 5, 7 for the number of committee members and 20–32, 35–40 for the workload in \\nhours per week of a company’s employees).\\nFigure 8-28 also shows that a faculty member plays the role of an instructor, as \\nwell as that of an adviser.

We could have named the association Advises; in this case, \\nhowever, the role names are sufficiently meaningful to convey the semantics of the \\nrelationship.\\nRepReSenting aSSoCiatiVe ClaSSeS\\nWhen an association itself has attributes or operations of its own or when it \\nparticipates in relationships with other classes, it is useful to model the association \\nas an  associative class (just as we used an associative entity in E-R diagramming). \\nFor example, in Figure 8-29, the attributes term and grade really belong to the \\nmany-to-many association between Student and Course. The grade of a student for \\na course cannot be determined unless both the student and the course are known. \\nSimilarly, to find the term(s) in which the student took the course, both student and \\ncourse must be known. The check Eligibility operation, which determines if a stu-\\ndent is eligible to register for a given course, also belongs to the association, rather \\nthan to any of the two participating classes. We have also captured the fact that, for \\nsome course registrations, a computer account is issued to a student. For these rea-\\nsons, we model Registration as an association class, with its own set of features and an \\nassociation with another class (Computer Account). Similarly, for the unary Tutors \\nassociation, beginDate and numberOfHrs (number of hours tutored) really belong \\nto the association, and therefore they appear in a separate association class.\\nYou have the option of showing the name of an association class on the associa-\\ntion path, on the class symbol, or both. When an association has only attributes but \\ndoes not have any operations or does not participate in other associations, the rec-\\nommended option is to show the name on the association path, but omit it from the \\nassociation class symbol, to emphasize its “association nature” (Bell, 2004). That is \\nhow we have shown the Tutors association. On the other hand, we have displayed the \\nname of the Registration association—which has two attributes and one operation \\nof its own, as well as an association called Issues with Computer Account—within the \\nclass rectangle to emphasize its “class nature.”\\nFigure 8-30 shows a ternary relationship among the Student, Software, and \\nCourse classes. It captures the fact that students use various software tools for dif-\\nferent courses. For example, we could store the information that Mary Jones used \\nMicrosoft Access and Oracle for the Database Management course, Rational Rose \\nand Visual C++ for the Object-Oriented Modeling course, and Jess for the Expert \\nSystems Course. Now suppose we want to estimate the number of hours per week \\nMary will spend using Oracle for the Database Management course. This process \\nreally belongs to the ternary association, and not to any of the individual classes. \\nHence, we have created an associative class called Log, within which we have de-\\nclared an operation called estimate Usage. In addition to this operation, we have \\nspecified three attributes that belong to the association: beginDate, expiryDate, and \\nAssociative class\\nAn association that has attributes or \\noperations of its own or that participates in \\nrelationships with other classes.\\nbeginDate\\nnumberOfHrs\\nacctID\\npassword\\nserverSpace\\nComputer Account\\nStudent\\npupil\\ntutor\\nTutors\\nIssues\\nCourse\\n* 0..1\\nterm\\ngrade\\ncheckEligibility (  )\\nRegistration\\n*\\n*\\n**Figure 8-29 \\nClass diagram showing associative \\nclasses'),\n",

Alternatively, the associative class Log can be placed at the intersec-\\ntion of the association lines, as shown in Figure 8-16; in this case, multiplicities are \\nrequired on all the lines next to the Log class.\\nRepReSenting SteReotypeS foR attRibuteS\\nIn E-R diagrams, we designated attributes as being primary keys, and we designated \\nthem as multivalued, derived, and other types. This can also be done in a class dia-\\ngram by placing a stereotype next to the attribute. Stereotypes simply extend the \\ncommon UML vocabulary. For instance, in Figure 8-31, age is a derived attribute of \\nStudent because it can be calculated from the date of birth and the current date. \\nBecause the calculation is a constraint on the object class, the calculation is shown on \\nthis diagram within braces near the Student object class. Also, the crseCode is a pri-\\nmary key for the Course class. Other properties of attributes can be similarly shown.\\nRepReSenting geneRalization\\nIn the object-oriented approach, you can abstract the common features (attributes \\nand operations) among multiple classes, as well as the relationships they participate \\nin, into a more general class, as we saw with supertype/subtype relationships in E-R \\ndiagramming. The classes that are generalized are called subclasses, and the class \\nthey are generalized into is called a superclass.\\nConsider the example shown in Figure 8-32, which is the class diagramming \\nequivalent of the E-R diagram in Figure 8-18. There are two types of patients: outpa-\\ntients and resident patients. The features that are shared by all patients—patientId, \\npatientName, and admitDate—are stored in the Patient superclass, whereas the fea-\\ntures that are peculiar to a particular patient type are stored in the corresponding \\nsubclass (e.g., checkbackDate of Outpatient).

We also specify that this generalization is dynamic, mean-\\ning that an object may change subtypes. This generalization is also complete (there \\nare no other subclasses) and disjoint (subclasses are not overlapping). Although not \\nusing exactly the same terminology, the same generalization business rules that we \\nsaw with E-R diagramming can be represented.\\nYou can indicate the basis of a generalization by specifying a discriminator next \\nto the path. A discriminator shows which property of an object class is being ab-\\nstracted by a particular generalization relationship. You can discriminate on only one \\nproperty at a time. For example, in Figure 8-32, we discriminate the Patient class on \\nthe basis of residency.\\nAn instance of a subclass is also an instance of its superclass. For example, in \\nFigure 8-32, an Outpatient instance is also a Patient instance. For that reason, a gen-\\neralization is also referred to as an Is-a relationship. Also, a subclass inherits all the \\nfeatures from its superclass. For example, in Figure 8-32, in addition to its own special \\nfeature—checkbackDate—the Outpatient subclass inherits patientId, patientName, \\nadmitDate, and any operations (not shown) from Patient.\\nNotice that in Figure 8-32, the Patient class is in italics, implying that it is an ab-\\nstract class. An abstract class is a class that has no direct instances but whose descen-\\ndants may have direct instances (Booch et al., 2007; Rumbaugh et al., 1991). (Note: \\nYou can also write the word abstract within braces just below the class name. This is \\nespecially useful when you generate a class diagram by hand.) A class that can have \\ndirect instances (e.g., Outpatient or Resident Patient) is called a concrete class. In \\nthis example, therefore, Outpatient and Resident Patient can have direct instances, \\nbut Patient cannot have any direct instances of its own.\\nThe Patient abstract class participates in a relationship called Treated-by with \\nPhysician, implying that all patients—outpatients and resident patients alike—are \\ntreated by physicians. In addition to this inherited relationship, the Resident Patient \\nclass has its own special relationship called Assigned-to with Bed, implying that only \\nresident patients may be assigned to beds. So, in addition to refining the attributes \\nand operations of a class, a subclass can also specialize the relationships in which it \\nparticipates.\\nIn Figure 8-32, the words complete and disjoint have been placed within braces \\nnext to the generalization. They indicate semantic constraints among the subclasses \\n(complete corresponds to total specialization in the Extended Entity Relationship \\n[EER] notation [see Hoffer et al., 2016], whereas incomplete corresponds to partial \\nspecialization). Any of the following UML keywords may be used:\\n•\\t Overlapping.

A descendant may not be descended from more than one of the  \\nsubclasses (same as the disjoint rule in EER diagramming).\\n•\\t Complete. All subclasses have been specified (whether or not shown). No  \\nadditional subclasses are expected (same as the total specialization rule in EER \\ndiagramming).\\n•\\t Incomplete. Some subclasses have been specified, but the list is known to be in-\\ncomplete. There are additional subclasses that are not yet in the model (same as \\nthe partial specialization rule in EER diagramming).\\nIn Figure 8-33, we represent both graduate and undergraduate students in a \\nmodel developed for student billing. The calc-tuition operation computes the tuition \\na student has to pay; this sum depends on the tuition per credit hour (tuitionPer-\\nCred), the courses taken, and the number of credit hours (creditHrs) for each of \\nthose courses. The tuition per credit hour, in turn, depends on whether the stu-\\ndent is a graduate or an undergraduate student. In this example, that amount is \\n$300 for all graduate students and $250 for all undergraduate students. To denote \\nthis, we have underlined the tuitionPerCred attribute in each of the two subclasses, \\nalong with its value. Such an attribute is called a class-scope attribute, which speci-\\nfies a value common to an entire class, rather than a specific value for an instance \\n(Rumbaugh et al., 1991).\\nYou can specify an initial default value of an attribute using an equals sign (=) \\nafter the attribute name (see creditHrs for the Course class in Figure 8-33). The dif-\\nference between an initial value specification and a class-scope attribute is that the \\nformer allows the possibility of different attribute values for the instances of a class, \\nand the latter forces all the instances to share a common value.\\nIn addition to specifying the multiplicity of an association role, you can also \\nspecify other properties, for example, if the objects playing the role are ordered or \\nnot. In the figure, we placed the keyword constraint “{ordered}” next to the Course \\nOffering end of the Scheduled-for relationship to denote the fact that the offerings \\nClass-scope attribute\\nAn attribute of a class that specifies a value \\ncommon to an entire class, rather than a \\nspecific value for an instance.\\nname\\nssn\\ndateOfBirth\\naddress\\nphone\\nregister-for (class)\\ncalc-tuition (  )\\nStudent\\n{abstract}\\nterm\\nsection\\nenrollment (  )\\nCourse\\nOﬀering\\ncrseCode\\ncrseTitle\\ncreditHrs=3\\nenrollment (  )\\nCourse\\nRegisters-for Scheduled-for\\n** * 1\\n{ordered}\\nundergradMajor\\ngreScore\\ngmatScore\\ntuitionPerCred=300\\ncalc-tuition (  )\\nGraduate\\nStudent\\nsatScore\\nactScore\\ntuitionPerCred=250\\ncalc-tuition (  )\\nUndergrad\\nStudent\\nFigure 8-33 \\nPolymorphism, abstract \\noperation, class-scope attribute, \\nand ordering'),\n",

The \\ndefault constraint on a role is “{unordered}.”\\nThe Graduate Student subclass specializes the abstract Student class by adding \\nfour attributes—undergradMajor, greScore, gmatScore, and tuitionPerCred—and by \\nrefining the inherited calc-tuition operation. Notice that the operation is shown in \\nitalics within the Student class, indicating that it is an abstract operation. An abstract \\n operation defines the form or protocol of the operation, but not its implementation. \\nIn this example, the Student class defines the protocol of the calc-tuition operation \\nwithout providing the corresponding method (the actual implementation of the oper-\\nation). The protocol includes the number and types of the arguments, the result type, \\nand the intended semantics of the operation. The two concrete subclasses, Graduate \\nStudent and Undergrad Student, supply their own implementations of the calc-tuition \\noperation. Note that because these classes are concrete, they cannot store abstract \\noperations.\\nIt is important to note that, although the Graduate Student and Undergraduate \\nStudent classes share the same calc-tuition operation, they might implement  \\nthe operation in quite different ways. For example, the method that implements the  \\noperation for a graduate student might add a special graduate fee for each course \\nthe student takes. The fact that the same operation may apply to two or more classes \\nin different ways is known as polymorphism, a key concept in object-oriented sys-\\ntems (Booch et al., 2007; Rumbaugh et al., 1991). The enrollment operation in \\nFigure 8-33 illustrates another example of polymorphism. Whereas the enrollment \\noperation within Course Offering computes the enrollment for a particular course \\noffering or section, an operation with the same name within Course computes the \\ncombined enrollment for all sections of a given course.\\nRepReSenting aggRegation\\nAn aggregation expresses a part-of relationship between a component object and \\nan aggregate object. It is a stronger form of association relationship (with the \\nadded\\xa0 “part-of” semantics) and is represented with a hollow diamond at the ag-\\ngregate end.\\nFigure 8-34 shows an aggregation structure of a university. Notice that the dia-\\nmond at one end of the relationship between Building and Room is solid, not hollow. \\nA solid diamond represents a stronger form of aggregation known as composition. In \\ncomposition, a part object belongs to only one whole object; for example, a room is \\npart of only one building. Therefore, the multiplicity on the aggregate end may not \\nexceed one. Parts may be created after the creation of the whole object; for example, \\nAbstract operation\\nDefines the form or protocol of the \\noperation, but not its implementation.\\nMethod\\nThe implementation of an operation.\\nPolymorphism\\nThe same operation may apply to two or \\nmore classes in different ways.\\nAggregation\\nA part-of relationship between a \\ncomponent object and an aggregate \\nobject.\\nComposition\\nA part-of relationship in which parts belong \\nto only one whole object, and the parts live \\nand die with the whole object.\\n1\\n1\\n11\\n*\\n1\\n20..*\\n1..* 1..*\\nAdministrative\\nUnit\\nDepartment\\nSchool Housed in\\nConsists of Part of\\nBuilding\\nRoom\\nUniversity\\nFigure 8-34 \\nAggregation and composition'),\n",

The DFD and decision table (repeated here as \\nFigures 8-35 and 8-36) describe requirements for this new system. The purpose of \\nthis system is to monitor and report changes in raw material inventory levels and \\nto issue material orders and payments to suppliers. Thus, the central data entity \\nfor this system will be an INVENTORY ITEM, corresponding to data store D1 in \\nFigure\\xa08-22.\\nChanges in inventory levels are due to two types of transactions: receipt of new \\nitems from suppliers and consumption of items from sales of products. Inventory is \\nadded upon receipt of new raw materials, for which Hoosier Burger receives a sup-\\nplier INVOICE (see Process 1.0 in Figure 8-35). Each INVOICE indicates that the sup-\\nplier has sent a specific quantity of one or more INVOICE_ITEMs, which correspond \\nto Hoosier’s INVENTORY ITEMs. Inventory is used when customers order and pay \\nfor PRODUCTs. That is, Hoosier makes a SALE for one or more ITEM SALEs, each \\nof which corresponds to a food PRODUCT. Because the real-time customer order \\nprocessing system is separate from the inventory control system, a source, STOCK \\nON HAND in Figure 8-35, represents how data flow from the order processing to \\nthe inventory control system. Finally, because food PRODUCTs are made up of vari-\\nous INVENTORY ITEMs (and vice versa), Hoosier maintains a RECIPE to indicate \\nhow much of each INVENTORY ITEM goes into making one PRODUCT. From this \\ndiscussion, we have identified the data entities required in a data model for the new \\nHoosier Burger inventory control system: INVENTORY ITEM, INVOICE, INVOICE \\nHOOSIER\\nBURGER'),\n",

To complete the data model, we \\nmust determine a necessary relationship between these entities as well as attributes for \\neach entity.\\nThe wording in the previous description tells us much of what we need to know \\nto determine relationships:\\n•\\t An INVOICE includes one or more INVOICE ITEMs, each of which corre-\\nsponds to an INVENTORY ITEM. Obviously, an INVOICE ITEM cannot exist \\nwithout an associated INVOICE, and over time there will be zero to many  \\nreceipts, or INVOICE ITEMs, for an INVENTORY ITEM.\\n•\\t Each PRODUCT has a RECIPE of INVENTORY ITEMs. Thus, RECIPE is an asso-\\nciative entity supporting a bill-of-materials type relationship between PRODUCT \\nand INVENTORY ITEM.\\n•\\t A SALE indicates that Hoosier sells one or more ITEM SALEs, each of which\\xa0cor-\\nresponds to a PRODUCT. An ITEM SALE cannot exist without an associated \\nSALE, and over time there will be zero to many ITEM SALEs for a PRODUCT.\\nFigure 8-37 shows a class diagram with the classes and relationships described \\nabove. In some cases, we include role names (e.g., a Sale plays the role of a transac-\\ntion in the Sells association). RECIPE is shown as an association class rather than as \\nsimply a relationship between PRODUCT and INVENTORY ITEM because it is likely \\nto have attributes and behaviors. Now that we understand the data classes and rela-\\ntionships, we must decide which data element and behaviors are associated with the \\ndata classes in this diagram. We have chosen to develop the conceptual data model \\nusing UML notation rather than E-R notation, but you should be able to easily trans-\\nlate the UML class diagrams into E-R diagrams (which is left as an exercise at the end \\nof this section).\\nYou may wonder at this point why only the INVENTORY data store is shown in \\nFigure 8-35 when there are seven data classes on the class diagram. The INVENTORY \\ndata store corresponds to the INVENTORY ITEM data class in Figure 8-37. The \\nother data classes are hidden inside other processes for which we have not shown \\nlower-level diagrams. In actual requirements structuring steps, you would have to \\nmatch all data classes with data stores: each data store represents some subset of a \\nclass or an E-R diagram, and each data class or entity is included in one or more data \\nstores. Ideally, each data store on a primitive DFD will be an individual data class or \\nentity.\\nTo determine data elements for a data class, we investigate data flows in and \\nout of data stores that correspond to the data class and supplement this with a study \\nof decision logic and temporal logic that uses or changes data about the data class. \\nConditions/ Rules\\nCourses of Action 12 34 56 7\\nT ype of item PP PP PP N\\nTime of week DW DW DW –\\nSeason of year AA SS HH –\\nStanding daily order XX X\\nStanding weekend order XX X\\nMinimum order quantity X\\nHoliday reduction XX\\nSummer reduction X X\\nFigure 8-36 \\nReduced decision table for Hoosier \\nBurger’s inventory reordering'),\n",

The \\ndescription of each data flow in the project dictionary or CASE repository would \\ninclude the data flow’s composition, which then tells us what data are flowing in or \\nout of the data store. For example, the Amounts Used data flow coming from Process \\n2.0 indicates how much to decrement an attribute Quantity_in_Stock due to use of \\nthe INVENTORY ITEM to fulfill a customer sale. Thus, the Amounts Used data flow \\nimplies that Process 2.0 will first read the relevant INVENTORY ITEM record, then \\nupdate its Quantity_in_Stock attribute, and finally store the updated value in the \\nrecord. Structured English for Process 2.0 would depict this logic. Each data flow \\nwould be analyzed similarly (space does not permit us to show the analysis for each \\ndata flow).\\nThe analysis of data flows for data elements is supplemented by a study of de-\\ncision logic. For example, consider the decision table in Figure 8-36. One condi-\\ntion used to determine the process of reordering an INVENTORY ITEM involves the \\nType_of_Item. Thus, Process 3.0 in Figure 8-35 (to which this decision table relates) \\nneeds to know this characteristic of each INVENTORY ITEM, so this identifies an-\\nother attribute of this data class.\\nAn analysis of the DFD and decision table also suggests possible operations \\nfor each class. For example, the Inventory Item class will need operations to up-\\ndate\\xa0 quantity on hand, generate replenishment orders, and receive inventory \\ncounts.\\nAfter considering all data flows in and out of data stores related to data classes, \\nplus all decision and temporal logic related to inventory control, we derive the full \\nclass diagram, with attributes and operations, shown in Figure 8-38.\\nSale\\ntransaction1\\nline item1..*\\nSells\\nItem Sale\\n0..nline item\\n1item sold\\nOrders\\nProduct\\nInvoice\\n1\\n1..*\\nIncludes\\nInvoice Item\\n*\\n1\\nReceives\\nInventory Item\\nRecipe\\n1..* 1..*\\nFigure 8-37 \\nPreliminary class diagram for Hoosier \\nBurger’s inventory control system'),\n",

He had just finished \\nhis house salad and was about to go back to his office \\nwhen Stephanie Welch sat down at his table. Jim had met \\nStephanie once, back when he started work at Petrie. He \\nremembered she worked for the database administrator.\\n“Hi, Jim, remember me?” she asked.\\n“Sure, Stephanie, how are you? How are things in data-\\nbase land?”\\n“Can’t complain. Sanjay asked me to talk to you about \\nthe database needs for your new customer loyalty sys-\\ntem.” Stephanie’s phone beeped. She pulled it out of her \\noversize bag and looked at it. She started to text as she \\ncontinued to talk to Jim. “How far along are you on your \\ndatabase requirements?”\\nThat’s kind of rude, Jim thought. Oh well. “We are still \\nin the early stages. I can send you a very preliminary E-R \\ndiagram we have (PE Figure 8-1), along with a description \\nof the major entities.”\\n“OK, that will help. I suspect that you won’t have too \\nmany new entities to add to what’s already in the system,” \\nStephanie responded, still looking at her phone and still \\ntexting. She briefly looked up at Jim and smiled slightly \\nbefore going back to texting. “Just send the E-R to me, \\nand I’ll let you know if I have any questions.” She stood \\nup, still looking at her phone. “Gotta go,” she said, and she \\nwalked away.\\nOK, Jim thought, I need to remember to send Stephanie \\nthe preliminary E-R we have. I should probably send her \\nthe entity descriptions too (PE Table 8-1), just in case. Jim \\nstood up, carried his tray over to the recycling area of the \\ncafeteria, and went back to his office.\\nWhen Jim got back to his office, Sanjay was waiting for \\nhim.\\n“I’ve got more information on those alternatives we \\ntalked about earlier,” Sanjay said. “I had one of my em-\\nployees gather some data on how the alternatives might \\nsatisfy our needs.” (See the descriptions of the alterna-\\ntives at the end of Chapter 6.) Sanjay handed Jim a short \\nreport. “The matrix shows the requirements and con-\\nstraints for each alternative and makes it relatively easy \\nto compare them.” (See PE Figure 8-2.)\\n“The matrix favors the XRA CRM system,” Jim said, after \\nlooking over the report. “It looks like their proposal meets \\nour requirements the best, but the Nova group’s proposal \\ndoes the best job with the constraints.”\\n“Yes, but just barely,” Sanjay said. “There is only a five \\npoint difference between XRA and Nova, so they are \\npretty comparable when it comes to constraints. But I \\nthink the XRA system has a pretty clear advantage in \\nmeeting our requirements.”\\n“XRA seems to be pretty highly rated in your matrix in \\nterms of all of the requirements. You have them ranked \\nbetter than the other two proposals for implementation, \\nscalability, and vendor support,” Jim said. “The ‘5’ you \\ngave them for proven performance is one of the few ‘5’s \\nyou have in your whole matrix.”\\n“That’s because they are one of the best companies in \\nthe industry to work with,” Sanjay responded. “Their rep-\\nutation is stellar.”\\n“This looks really promising,” Jim said. “Let’s see if real-\\nity matches what we have here. It’s time to put together the \\nformal request for proposal.

Coupons can only be created for an individual customer based on the points in his or her customer loyalty \\naccount. For each dollar value of a coupon, a certain number of points must be redeemed. Coupons must be \\naccounted for when created and when redeemed.\\nCustomer A customer is someone who buys products and/or services from Petrie Electronics. Customers include both online \\ncustomers and those who shop in Petrie’s brick-and-mortar stores.\\nProduct An item made available for sale to a Petrie customer. For example, a product is a 40” Sony LCD HD television. Products \\ncan be purchased online or in brick-and-mortar stores.\\nPromotion A promotion is a special incentive provided to a customer to entice the customer into buying a specific product or \\nservice. For example, a promotion intended to sell Blu-ray discs may involve 2-for-1 coupons. Promotions are targeted \\nto all customers, or to subsets of customers, not just to individual customers.\\nService A job performed by one of Petrie’s associates for a customer.

The ac-\\ntivities within design are not necessarily sequential. For \\nexample, the design of data, system inputs and outputs, \\nand interfaces interact, allowing you to identify flaws and \\nmissing elements. This means that the project dictionary \\nor CASE repository becomes an active and evolving com-\\nponent of systems development management during de-\\nsign. It is only when each design element is consistent \\nwith others and each one is satisfactory to the end user \\nthat you know that the design phase is complete.\\nData are a core system element, and data design \\nand structure are studied in all systems development \\nmethodologies. You have seen how data flow diagrams \\n(DFDs) and entity-relationship (E-R) diagrams (as well \\nas use cases and class diagrams from the object-oriented \\nmaterial at the end of prior chapters) are used to  depict \\nthe data requirements of a system. These diagrams are \\nflexible and allow considerable latitude in how you \\n represent data. For example, you can use one or many \\ndata stores with a process in a DFD. E-R diagrams pro-\\nvide more structure, but an entity can still be either very \\ndetailed or rather aggregate. When designing databases, \\nyou define data in its most fundamental form, called \\nnormalized data. Normalization is a well-defined method \\nof identifying relationships between each data attribute \\nand representing all the data so that they cannot logi-\\ncally be broken down into more detail. The goal is to rid \\nthe data design of unwanted anomalies that would make \\na database susceptible to errors and inefficiencies. This is \\nthe topic of Chapter 9.\\nIn Chapter 10, you will learn the principles and \\nguidelines for usable system inputs and outputs. Your \\noverall goal in formatting the presentation of data to \\nusers should be usability: helping users of all types to use \\nthe system efficiently, accurately, and with satisfaction. \\nThe achievement of these goals can be greatly improved \\nif you follow certain guidelines when presenting data \\non business forms, visual display screens, printed docu-\\nments, and other kinds of media. Fortunately, there has \\nbeen considerable research on how to present data to \\nusers, and Chapter 10 summarizes and illustrates the most \\n useful of these guidelines. Chapter 11 is closely  related to \\nChapter 10 and addresses principles you should follow \\nin tying all the system inputs and outputs together into \\nan overall pattern of interaction between users and the \\nsystem. System interfaces and dialogues form a conversa-\\ntion that provides user access to and navigation between \\neach system function. Chapter 11  focuses on providing \\nspecifications for designing effective system interfaces \\nand dialogues and a technique for representing these \\ndesigns called dialogue diagramming.\\nFor traditional development efforts, before devel-\\nopers can begin the implementation process, questions \\nabout multiple users, multiple platforms, and program \\nand data distribution have to be considered. The extent \\nto which the system is Internet-based also has an impact \\non numerous design issues. The focus of Chapter 12 is \\non the intricacies of designing distributed and Internet \\nsystems.\\nThe deliverables of design include detailed, func-\\ntional specifications for system inputs, outputs, inter -\\nfaces, dialogues, and databases. Often these elements \\nare represented in prototypes, or working versions. \\nThe  project dictionary or CASE repository is updated \\nto  include each form, report, interface, dialogue, and \\n relation design. Due to considerable user involvement in \\nreviewing prototypes and specifications during design, \\nand due to the fact that activities within design can be \\nscheduled with considerable overlap in the project base-\\nline plan, a formal review milestone or walk-through \\noften does not occur after each activity. If prototyping \\nis not done, however, you should conduct a formal walk-\\nthrough at the completion of the system design phase.\\nAll of the chapters in Part Four conclude with a \\nPetrie Electronics case. These cases illustrate numerous \\nrelevant design activities for an ongoing systems develop-\\nment project within the company.\\nPart Four \\nDesign'),\n",

Develop a logical database design that reflects the \\n actual data requirements that exist in the forms (hard \\ncopy and computer displays) and reports of an infor-\\nmation system.

The most common style for \\na logical database model is the relational database model. Once you develop a clear \\nand precise logical database model, you are ready to prescribe the technical specifi-\\ncations for computer files and databases in which to store the data. A physical data-\\nbase design provides these specifications.\\nYou typically do logical and physical database design in parallel with other systems \\ndesign steps. Thus, you collect the detailed specifications of data necessary for logical \\ndatabase design as you design system inputs and outputs. Logical database design is \\ndriven not only from the previously developed E-R data model for the  application or \\nenterprise but also from form and report layouts. You study data elements on these \\nsystem inputs and outputs and identify interrelationships among the data. As with con-\\nceptual data modeling, the work of all systems development team members is coordi-\\nnated and shared through the project dictionary or repository. The designs for logical \\ndatabases and system inputs and outputs are then used in physical  design activities to \\nspecify to computer programmers, database administrators,  network managers, and \\nothers how to implement the new information system. For\\xa0this text, we assume that the \\ndesign of computer programs and distributed information processing and data net-\\nworks are topics of other courses, so we concentrate on the aspect of physical design \\nmost often undertaken by a systems analyst—  physical file and database design.\\nthe Process of Database Design\\nFigure 9-2 shows that database modeling and design activities occur in all phases of \\nthe systems development process. In this chapter, we discuss methods that help you \\nfinalize logical and physical database designs during the design phase. In logical data-\\nbase design, you use a process called normalization, which is a way to build a data model \\nthat has the properties of simplicity, nonredundancy, and minimal maintenance.\\nIn most situations, many physical database design decisions are implicit or \\neliminated when you choose the data management technologies to use with the \\n application. We concentrate on those decisions you will make most frequently and \\nuse Oracle to illustrate the range of physical database design parameters you must \\nDesignImplementation\\nPlanning\\nMaintenance Analysis\\nDatabases\\nForms and Reports\\nDialogues and Interfaces\\nFinalizing Design Speciﬁcations\\nDistributed and Internet Systems\\nFigure 9-1 \\nSystems development life cycle with \\ndesign phase highlighted'),\n",

The interested reader is referred to Hoffer, Ramesh, and Topi (2016) for \\na more thorough treatment of techniques for logical and physical database design.\\nThere are four key steps in logical database modeling and design:\\n1. Develop a logical data model for each known user interface (form and report) \\nfor the application using normalization principles.\\n2. Combine normalized data requirements from all user interfaces into one con-\\nsolidated logical database model; this step is called view integration.\\n3. Translate the conceptual E-R data model for the application or enterprise, devel-\\noped without explicit consideration of specific user interfaces, into normalized \\ndata requirements.\\n4. Compare the consolidated logical database design with the translated E-R model \\nand produce, through view integration, one final logical database model for the \\napplication.\\nDuring physical database design, you use the results of these four key logical \\ndatabase design steps. You also consider definitions of each attribute; descriptions of \\nwhere and when data are entered, retrieved, deleted, and updated; expectations for \\nresponse time and data integrity; and descriptions of the file and database technolo-\\ngies to be used. These inputs allow you to make key physical database design deci-\\nsions, including the following:\\n•\\t Choosing the storage format (called data type) for each attribute from the logical \\ndatabase model; the format is chosen to minimize storage space and to maxi-\\nmize data quality. Data type involves choosing length, coding scheme, number \\nof decimal places, minimum and maximum values, and potentially many other \\nparameters for each attribute.\\n•\\t Grouping attributes from the logical database model into physical records (in \\ngeneral, this is called selecting a stored record, or data, structure).\\n•\\t Arranging related records in secondary memory (hard disks and magnetic tapes) \\nso that individual records and groups of records can be stored, retrieved, and \\n updated rapidly (called file organization). You should also consider protecting \\ndata and recovering data after errors are found.\\nDesignImplementation\\nPlanning\\nMaintenance Analysis\\n• Enterprise-wide data model (E-R with only entities)\\n• Conceptual data mode (E-R with only entities for\\n speciﬁc project)\\n• Data model\\n evolution\\n• Database and ﬁle deﬁnitions\\n (DBMS speciﬁc code)\\n• Logical data model (relational)\\n and physical ﬁle and database\\n design (ﬁle organizations)\\n• Conceptual data\\n models (E-R with\\n attributes)\\nFigure 9-2 \\nRelationship between data modeling and \\nthe SDLC'),\n",

The primary \\nstructure used today to make access to data more rapid is key indexes on unique \\nand nonunique keys.\\nIn this chapter, we show how to do each of these logical database design steps \\nand discuss factors to consider in making each physical file and database design \\ndecision.\\nDeliverables and Outcomes\\nDuring logical database design, you must account for every data element on a system \\ninput or output—form or report—and on the E-R diagram. Each data element (e.g., \\ncustomer name, product description, or purchase price) must be a piece of raw data \\nkept in the system’s database or, in the case of a data element on a system output, the \\nelement can be derived from data in the database. Figure 9-3 illustrates the outcomes \\nfrom the four-step logical database design process listed earlier. Figures 9-3a and 9-3b \\n(step 1) contain two sample system outputs for a customer order processing system at \\nPine Valley Furniture (PVF). A description of the associated database requirements, \\nin the form of what we call normalized relations, is listed below each output diagram. \\nEach relation (think of a relation as a table with rows and columns) is named, and its \\nattributes (columns) are listed within parentheses. The primary key attribute—that \\nattribute whose value is unique across all occurrences of the relation—is indicated by \\nan underline, and an attribute of a relation that is the primary key of another rela-\\ntion is indicated by a dashed underline.\\nIn Figure 9-3a, data about customers, products, and the customer orders and \\nassociated line items for products are shown. Each of the attributes of each rela-\\ntion either appears in the display or is needed to link connected relations. For \\n example, because an order is for a customer, an attribute of ORDER is the associated \\nCustomer_ID. The data for the display in Figure 9-3b are more complex. A back-\\nlogged product on an order occurs when the amount ordered (Order_Quantity) is \\nless than the amount shipped (Ship_Quantity) for invoices associated with an order. \\nThe query refers only to a specified time period, so the Order_Date is needed. The \\nINVOICE Order_Number links invoices with the associated order.\\nFigure 9-3c (step 2) shows the result of integrating these two separate sets of \\nnormalized relations. Figure 9-3d (step 3) shows an E-R diagram for a customer \\norder processing application that might be developed during conceptual data mod-\\neling, along with equivalent normalized relations. Finally, Figure 9-3e (step 4) shows \\na set of normalized relations that would result from reconciling the logical database \\ndesigns of Figures 9-3c and 9-3d. Normalized relations like those in Figure 9-3e are \\nthe primary deliverable from logical database design.\\nIt is important to remember that relations do not correspond to computer files. In \\nphysical database design, you translate the relations from logical database design into \\nspecifications for computer files. For most information systems, these files will be tables \\nin a relational database. These specifications are sufficient for programmers and data-\\nbase analysts to code the definitions of the database. The coding, done during systems \\nimplementation, is written in special database definition and processing languages, \\nsuch as Structured Query Language (SQL), or by filling in table definition forms, such \\nas with Microsoft Access.

Further, this table is only \\none table in the Pine Valley Furniture Company Order Entry database, and other \\ntables and structures for this database are not illustrated in this figure.\\nthe Relational Database Model\\nMany different database models are in use and are the bases for database technolo-\\ngies. Although hierarchical and network models have been popular in the past, these \\nare not used very often today for new information systems. Object-oriented data-\\nbase models are emerging but are still not common. The vast majority of informa-\\ntion systems today use the relational database model. The relational database model \\n(Codd, 1970; Date, 2012; Elmasri and Navathe, 2015; Umanath and Scamell, 2014) \\nrepresents data in the form of related tables, or relations. A relation is a named, two- \\ndimensional table of data. Each relation (or table) consists of a set of named columns \\nand an arbitrary number of unnamed rows. Each column in a relation corresponds \\nto an attribute of that relation. Each row of a relation corresponds to a record that \\ncontains data values for an entity.\\nFigure 9-5 shows an example of a relation named EMPLOYEE1. This relation \\ncontains the following attributes describing employees: Emp_ID, Name, Dept, and \\nSalary. This table has five sample rows, corresponding to five employees.\\nYou can express the structure of a relation with a shorthand notation in which \\nthe name of the relation is followed (in parentheses) by the names of the attributes \\nin the relation. The identifier attribute (called the primary key of the relation) is under-\\nlined. For example, you would express EMPLOYEE1 as follows:\\nEMPLOYEE1(Emp_ID,Name,Dept,Salary)\\nNot all tables are relations. Relations have several properties that distinguish them \\nfrom nonrelational tables:\\n1. Entries in cells are simple. An entry at the intersection of each row and column \\nhas a single value.\\n2. Entries in a given column are from the same set of values.\\n3. Each row is unique. Uniqueness is guaranteed because the relation has a non-\\nempty primary key value.\\n4. The sequence of columns can be interchanged without changing the meaning or \\nuse of the relation.\\n5. The rows may be interchanged or stored in any sequences.\\nWell-structured Relations\\nWhat constitutes a well-structured relation (also known as a table)? Intuitively, a well-\\nstructured relation contains a minimum amount of redundancy and allows users \\nto insert, modify, and delete the rows in a table without errors or inconsistencies. \\nrelational database model\\nData represented as a set of related tables \\nor relations.\\nrelation\\nA named, two-dimensional table of data. \\nEach relation consists of a set of named \\ncolumns and an arbitrary number of \\nunnamed rows.\\nWell-structured relation\\nA relation that contains a minimum amount \\nof redundancy and that allows users to \\ninsert, modify, and delete the rows without \\nerror or inconsistencies; also known as \\na\\xa0table.\\nEMPLOYEE1\\nEmp_ID Name Dept Salary\\n100 Margaret Simpson Marketing 75,000\\n140A llen Beeton Accounting 95,000\\n110 Chris Lucero Info Systems 90,000\\n190 Lorenzo Davis Finance 90,000\\n150 Susan Martin Marketing 62,000\\nFigure 9-5 \\nEMPLOYEE1 relation with sample data'),\n",

Each row of the table contains data \\ndescribing one employee, and any modification to an employee’s data (such as a \\nchange in salary) is confined to one row of the table.\\nIn contrast, EMPLOYEE2 (Figure 9-6) contains data about employees and the \\ncourses they have completed. Each row in this table is unique for the combination \\nof Emp_ID and Course, which becomes the primary key for the table. This is not a \\nwell-structured relation, however. If you examine the sample data in the table, you \\nnotice a considerable amount of redundancy. For example, the Emp_ID, Name, \\nDept, and Salary values appear in two separate rows for employees 100, 110, and 150. \\nConsequently, if the salary for employee 100 changes, we must record this fact in two \\nrows (or more, for some employees).\\nThe problem with this relation is that it contains data about two  entities: \\nEMPLOYEE and COURSE. You will learn to use principles of normalization \\nto  divide EMPLOYEE2 into two relations. One of the resulting relations is \\nEMPLOYEE1\\xa0(Figure\\xa09-5). The other we will call EMP COURSE, which appears \\nwith sample data in Figure 9-7. The primary key of this relation is the combination \\nof Emp_ID and Course (we emphasize this by underlining the column names for \\nthese attributes).\\nnORMalizatiOn\\nWe have presented an intuitive discussion of well-structured relations; however, we \\nneed rules and a process for designing them.

There are many nor -\\nmalization rules, more than can be covered in this text (see Hoffer et al. [2011], for \\na more complete coverage). Besides the five properties of relations outlined previ-\\nously, there are two other frequently used rules:\\n1. Second normal form (2NF). Each nonprimary key attribute is identified by the \\nwhole key (what we call full functional dependency). For example, in Figure 9-7, \\nboth Emp_ID and Course identify a value of Date_Completed because the same \\nEmp_ID can be associated with more than one Date_Completed and the same \\nfor Course.\\n2. Third normal form (3NF). Nonprimary key attributes do not depend on each other \\n(what we call no transitive dependencies). For example, in Figure 9-5, Name, \\nDept, and Salary cannot be guaranteed to be unique for one another.\\nThe result of normalization is that every nonprimary key attribute depends \\nupon the whole primary key and nothing but the primary key. We discuss second and \\nthird normal form in more detail next.\\nFunctional Dependence and Primary Keys\\nNormalization is based on the analysis of functional dependence. A functional \\n dependency is a particular relationship between two attributes. In a given relation, \\nattribute B is functionally dependent on attribute A if, for every valid value of A, that \\nvalue of A uniquely determines the value of B (Date, 2012; Hoffer et al., 2016). The \\nfunctional dependence of B on A is represented by an arrow, as follows: A S B (e.g., \\nEmp_ID S Name in the relation of Figure 9-5). Functional dependence does not \\nimply mathematical dependence—that the value of one attribute may be computed \\nfrom the value of another attribute; rather, functional dependence of B on A means \\nthat there can be only one value of B for each value of A. Thus, a given Emp_ID value \\ncan have only one Name value associated with it; the value of Name, however, can-\\nnot be derived from the value of Emp_ID. Other examples of functional dependen-\\ncies from Figure 9-3b are in ORDER, Order_Number, Order_Date, and in INVOICE, \\nInvoice_Number, Invoice_Date, and Order_Number.\\nAn attribute may be functionally dependent on two (or more) attributes \\nrather than on a single attribute. For example, consider the relation EMP COURSE \\n(Emp_ID,Course,Date_Completed) shown in Figure 9-7. We represent the  functional \\ndependency in this relation as follows:\\nEmp_ID,Course S Date_Completed (this is sometimes shown as Emp_ID + \\nCourse S Date_Completed). In this case, Date_Completed cannot be determined \\nby either Emp_ID or Course alone because Date_Completed is a characteristic of an \\nemployee taking a course.\\nYou should be aware that the instances (or sample data) in a relation do not \\nprove that a functional dependency exists. Only knowledge of the problem domain, \\nobtained from a thorough requirements analysis, is a reliable method for identifying \\na functional dependency. However, you can use sample data to demonstrate that a \\nfunctional dependency does not exist between two or more attributes. For example, \\nconsider the sample data in the relation EXAMPLE(A,B,C,D), shown in Figure 9-8. \\nThe sample data in this relation prove that attribute B is not functionally dependent \\non attribute A because A does not uniquely determine B (two rows with the same \\nvalue of A have different values of B).\\nFunctional dependency\\nA constraint between two attributes \\nin which the value of one attribute is \\ndetermined by the value of another \\nattribute.\\nAB CD\\nXU\\nYX\\nZY\\nYZ\\nXY\\nZX\\nYY\\nWZ\\nEXAMPLE\\nFigure 9-8 \\nEXAMPLE relation'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\ASUS\\\\Desktop\\\\AI powered chatbot\\\\Data\\\\SAD.pdf', 'page': 344}, page_content='320 Part IV   Design\\nsecond normal Form\\nA relation is in second normal form (2NF) if every nonprimary key attribute is func-\\ntionally dependent on the whole primary key. Thus, no nonprimary key attribute is \\nfunctionally dependent on part, but not all, of the primary key. Second normal form \\nis satisfied if any one of the following conditions apply:\\n1. The primary key consists of only one attribute (such as the attribute Emp_ID in \\nrelation EMPLOYEE1).\\n2. No nonprimary key attributes exist in the relation.\\n3. Every nonprimary key attribute is functionally dependent on the full set of pri-\\nmary key attributes.\\nEMPLOYEE2 (Figure 9-6) is an example of a relation that is not in second nor-\\nmal form. The shorthand notation for this relation is\\nEMPLOYEE2(Emp_ID,Name,Dept,Salary,Course,Date_Completed)\\nThe functional dependencies in this relation are the following:\\nEmp_ID S Name,Dept,Salary\\nEmp_ID,Course S Date_Completed\\nThe primary key for this relation is the composite key Emp_ID,Course. \\nTherefore, the nonprimary key attributes Name, Dept, and Salary are functionally \\ndependent on only Emp_ID but not on Course. EMPLOYEE2 has redundancy, which \\nresults in problems when the table is updated.\\nTo convert a relation to second normal form, you decompose the relation into \\nnew relations using the attributes, called determinants, that determine other attri-\\nbutes; the determinants are the primary keys of these relations. EMPLOYEE2 is de-\\ncomposed into the following two relations:\\n1. EMPLOYEE(Emp_ID,Name,Dept,Salary): This relation satisfies the first second \\nnormal form condition (sample data shown in Figure 9-5).\\n2. EMP COURSE(Emp_ID,Course,Date_Completed): This relation satisfies second \\nnormal form condition three (sample data appear in Figure 9-7).\\nthird normal Form\\nA relation is in third normal form (3NF) if it is in second normal form and there are \\nno functional dependencies between two (or more) nonprimary key attributes (a \\nfunctional dependency between nonprimary key attributes is also called a transitive \\ndependency). For example, consider the relation SALES (Customer_ID, Customer_ \\nName,Salesperson,Region) (sample data shown in Figure 9-9a).\\nThe following functional dependencies exist in the SALES relation:\\n1. Customer_ID S Customer_Name,Salesperson,Region (Customer_ID is the \\n primary key.)\\n2. Salesperson S Region (Each salesperson is assigned to a unique region.)\\nNotice that SALES is in second normal form because the primary key consists \\nof a single attribute (Customer_ID). However, Region is functionally dependent on \\nSalesperson, and Salesperson is functionally dependent on Customer_ID. As a result, \\nthere are data maintenance problems in SALES.\\n1. A new salesperson (Robinson) assigned to the North region cannot be entered \\nuntil a customer has been assigned to that salesperson (because a value for \\n Customer_ID must be provided to insert a row in the table).\\nSecond normal form (2NF)\\nA relation is in second normal form if every \\nnonprimary key attribute is functionally \\ndependent on the whole primary key.\\nThird normal form (3NF)\\nA relation is in second normal form and \\nhas no functional (transitive) dependencies \\nbetween two (or more) nonprimary key \\nattributes.'),\n",

If customer number 6837 is deleted from the table, we lose the information that \\nsalesperson Hernandez is assigned to the East region.\\n3. If salesperson Smith is reassigned to the East region, several rows must be \\nchanged to reflect that fact (two rows are shown in Figure 9-9a).\\nThese problems can be avoided by decomposing SALES into the two rela-\\ntions, based on the two determinants, shown in Figure 9-9b. These relations are the \\nfollowing:\\nSALES1(Customer_ID,Customer_Name,Salesperson)\\nSPERSON(Salesperson,Region)\\nNote that Salesperson is the primary key in SPERSON. Salesperson is also a \\nforeign key in SALES1. A foreign key is an attribute that appears as a nonprimary key \\nattribute in one relation (such as SALES1) and as a primary key attribute (or part \\nof a primary key) in another relation. You designate a foreign key by using a dashed \\nunderline.\\nA foreign key must satisfy referential integrity, which specifies that the value of \\nan attribute in one relation depends on the value of the same attribute in another \\nrelation. Thus, in Figure 9-9b, the value of Salesperson in each row of table SALES1 is \\nlimited only to the current values of Salesperson in the SPERSON table. If some sales \\ndo not have to have a salesperson, then it is possible for the value of Salesperson to \\nbe null (i.e., have no value).

These steps are summarized briefly here, and then steps 1, 2, and 4 are \\ndiscussed in detail in the remainder of this chapter.\\n1. Represent entities. Each entity type in the E-R diagram becomes a relation. The \\nidentifier of the entity type becomes the primary key of the relation, and other \\nattributes of the entity type become nonprimary key attributes of the relation.\\n2. Represent relationships. Each relationship in an E-R diagram must be represented \\nin the relational database design. How we represent a relationship depends on \\nits nature. For example, in some cases we represent a relationship by making the \\nprimary key of one relation a foreign key of another relation. In other cases, we \\ncreate a separate relation to represent a relationship.\\n3. Normalize the relations. The relations created in steps 1 and 2 may have unnec -\\nessary redundancy. So we need to normalize these relations to make them well \\nstructured.\\n4. Merge the relations. So far in database design we have created various relations \\nfrom both a bottom-up normalization of user views and from transforming one or \\nmore E-R diagrams into sets of relations. Across these different sets of relations, \\nthere may be redundant relations (two or more relations that describe the same \\nentity type) that must be merged and renormalized to remove the redundancy.\\nRepresent entities\\nEach regular entity type in an E-R diagram is transformed into a relation. The \\nidentifier of the entity type becomes the primary key of the corresponding rela-\\ntion. Each nonkey attribute of the entity type becomes a nonkey attribute of the \\nrelation. You should check to make sure that the primary key satisfies the following \\ntwo properties:\\n1. The value of the key must uniquely identify every row in the relation.\\n2. The key should be nonredundant; that is, no attribute in the key can be deleted \\nwithout destroying its unique identification.\\nSome entities may have keys that include the primary keys of other entities. For \\nexample, an EMPLOYEE DEPENDENT may have a Name for each dependent, but \\nto form the primary key for this entity, you must include the Employee_ID attribute \\nfrom the associated EMPLOYEE entity. Such an entity whose primary key depends \\nupon the primary key of another entity is called a weak entity.\\nRepresentation of an entity as a relation is straightforward. Figure 9-10a shows \\nthe CUSTOMER entity type for PVF. The corresponding CUSTOMER relation is rep-\\nresented as follows:\\nCUSTOMER(Customer_ID,Name,Address,City_State_ZIP,Discount)\\nIn this notation, the entity type label is translated into a relation name. The \\nidentifier of the entity type is listed first and underlined. All nonkey attributes are \\nlisted after the primary key. This relation is shown as a table with sample data in \\nFigure 9-10b.\\nRepresent Relationships\\nThe procedure for representing relationships depends on both the degree of the \\nrelationship—unary, binary, ternary—and the cardinalities of the relationship.'),\n",

Two relations, CUSTOMER and ORDER, were \\nformed from the respective entity types (see Figure 9-11b). Customer_ID, which is \\nthe primary key of CUSTOMER (on the one side of the relationship), is added as a \\nforeign key to ORDER (on the many side of the relationship). One special case under \\nthis rule was mentioned in the previous section. If the entity on the many side needs \\nthe key of the entity on the one side as part of its primary key (this is a so-called weak \\nentity), then this attribute is added, not as a nonkey but as part of the primary key.\\nFor a binary or unary one-to-one (1:1) relationship between two entities A and \\nB (for a unary relationship, A and B would be the same entity type), the relationship \\ncan be represented by any of the following choices:\\n1.

In such \\ncases, we create a separate relation that has as a primary key the composite of the \\nprimary keys of each of the participating entities (plus any necessary additional key \\n elements). This rule is a simple generalization of the rule for a binary M :N relationship.\\nUnary Relationships To review, a unary relationship is a relationship between the \\ninstances of a single entity type, which are also called recursive relationships. Figure\\xa09-13 \\nshows two common examples. Figure 9-13a shows a one-to-many relationship named \\nManages that associates employees with another employee who is their manager. \\nFigure 9-13b shows a many-to-many relationship that associates certain items with \\ntheir component items. This relationship is called a bill-of-materials structure.\\nFor a unary 1:N relationship, the entity type (such as EMPLOYEE) is modeled as \\na relation. The primary key of that relation is the same as for the entity type. Then a \\nforeign key is added to the relation that references the primary key values. A  recursive \\nforeign key is a foreign key in a relation that references the primary key values of that \\nsame relation. We can represent the relationship in Figure 9-13a as\\xa0follows:\\nEMPLOYEE(Emp_ID,Name,Birthdate,Manager_ID)\\nIn this relation, Manager_ID is a recursive foreign key that takes its values from \\nthe same set of worker identification numbers as Emp_ID.\\nFor a unary M :N relationship, we model the entity type as one relation. Then we \\ncreate a separate relation to represent the M :N relationship. The primary key of this \\nnew relation is a composite key that consists of two attributes (which need not have \\nthe same name) that both take their values from the same primary key.

Table 9-1 lists the \\nrules discussed in this section for transforming E-R diagrams into equivalent  relations. \\nAfter this transformation, you should check the resulting relations to  determine \\nwhether they are in third normal form and, if necessary, perform normaliza tion as \\ndescribed earlier in this chapter.\\nMeRging RelatiOns\\nAs part of the logical database design, normalized relations likely have been created \\nfrom a number of separate E-R diagrams and various user interfaces. Some of the re-\\nlations may be redundant—they may refer to the same entities. If so, you should merge \\nthose relations to remove the redundancy. This section describes merging relations, or \\nview integration, which is the last step in logical database design and prior to physical \\nfile and database design.\\nan example of Merging Relations\\nSuppose that modeling a user interface or transforming an E-R diagram results in \\nthe following 3NF relation:\\nEMPLOYEE1(Emp_ID,Name,Address,Phone)\\nTable 9-1  e-R Diagrams to Relational Transformation\\nE-R Structure Relational Representation\\nRegular entity Create a relation with primary key and nonkey attributes.\\nWeak entity Create a relation with a composite primary key (which includes the \\nprimary key of the entity on which this weak entity depends) and \\nnonkey attributes.\\nBinary or unary 1:1 \\nrelationship\\nPlace the primary key of either entity in the relation for the other \\nentity or do this for both entities.\\nBinary 1:N relationship Place the primary key of the entity on the one side of the relationship \\nas a foreign key in the relation for the entity on the many side.\\nBinary or unary M:N \\nrelationship or \\nassociative entity\\nCreate a relation with a composite primary key using the primary \\nkeys of the related entities, plus any nonkey attributes associative \\nentity of the relationship or associative entity.\\nBinary or unary M:N \\nrelationship or \\nassociative entity \\nwith additional key(s)\\nCreate a relation with a composite primary key using the primary \\nkeys of the related entities and additional primary key attributes \\nassociated with the relationship or associative entity, plus any \\nnonkey attributes of the relationship or associative entity.\\nBinary or unary M:N \\nrelationship or \\nassociative entity \\nwith its own key\\nCreate a relation with the primary key associated with the relationship \\nor associative entity, plus any nonkey attributes of the relationship \\nor associative entity and the primary keys of the related entities \\n(as\\xa0foreign key attributes).\\nSupertype/subtype Create a relation for the superclass, which contains the primary \\nrelationship key and all nonkey attributes in common with all \\nsubclasses, plus create a separate relation for each subclass with \\nthe same primary key (with the same or local name) but with only \\nthe nonkey attributes related to that subclass.'),\n",

The result of merging the \\nrelations is the following relation:\\nEMPLOYEE(Emp_ID,Name,Address,Phone,Jobcode,Number_of_Years)\\nNotice that an attribute that appears in both relations (such as Name in this \\nexample) appears only once in the merged relation.\\nView integration Problems\\nWhen integrating relations, you must understand the meaning of the data and be \\nprepared to resolve any problems that may arise in the process. In this section, we \\ndescribe and illustrate four problems that arise in view integration: synonyms, hom-\\nonyms, dependencies between nonkeys, and class/subclass relationships.\\nSynonyms In some situations, two or more attributes may have different names but \\nthe same meaning, as when they describe the same characteristic of an entity. Such \\nattributes are called synonyms. For example, Emp_ID and Employee_Number may \\nbe synonyms.\\nWhen merging relations that contain synonyms, you should obtain, if possible, \\nagreement from users on a single standardized name for the attribute and eliminate \\nthe other synonym. Another alternative is to choose a third name to replace the syn-\\nonyms. For example, consider the following relations:\\nSTUDENT1(Student_ID,Name)\\nSTUDENT2(Matriculation_Number,Name,Address)\\nIn this case, the analyst recognizes that both the Student_ID and the \\nMatriculation_Number are synonyms for a person’s social security number (SSN) \\nand are identical attributes. One possible resolution would be to standardize one of \\nthe two attribute names, such as Student_ID. Another option is to use a new attribute \\nname, such as SSN, to replace both synonyms. With the latter approach, merging the \\ntwo relations would produce the following result:\\nSTUDENT(SSN,Name,Address)\\nHomonyms In other situations, a single attribute name, called a homonym, may \\nhave more than one meaning or describe more than one characteristic. For example, \\nthe term account might refer to a bank’s checking account, savings account, loan \\n account, or other type of account; therefore, account refers to different data, depend-\\ning on how it is used.\\nYou should be on the lookout for homonyms when merging relations. Consider \\nthe following example:\\nSTUDENT1(Student_ID,Name,Address)\\nSTUDENT2(Student_ID,Name,Phone_Number,Address)\\nIn discussions with users, the systems analyst may discover that the attribute \\nAddress in STUDENT1 refers to a student’s campus address, whereas in STUDENT2 \\nthe same attribute refers to a student’s home address. To resolve this conflict, \\nSynonym\\nTwo different names that are used for the \\nsame attribute.\\nHomonym\\nA single attribute name that is used for two \\nor more different attributes.'),\n",

For example, consider \\nthe following two relations:\\nSTUDENT1(Student_ID,Major)\\nSTUDENT2(Student_ID,Adviser)\\nBecause STUDENT1 and STUDENT2 have the same primary key, the two rela-\\ntions may be merged:\\nSTUDENT(Student_ID,Major,Adviser)\\nHowever, suppose that each major has exactly one adviser. In this case, Adviser \\nis functionally dependent on Major:\\nMajor S Adviser\\nIf this dependency exists, then STUDENT is in 2NF but not 3NF because it \\ncontains a functional dependency between nonkeys. The analyst can create 3NF rela-\\ntions by creating two relations with Major as a foreign key in STUDENT:\\nSTUDENT(Student_ID,Major)\\nMAJOR ADVISER(Major,Adviser)\\nClass/Subclass Class/subclass relationships may be hidden in user views or rela-\\ntions. Suppose that we have the following two hospital relations:\\nPATIENT1(Patient_ID,Name,Address,Date_Treated)\\nPATIENT2(Patient_ID,Room_Number)\\nInitially, it appears that these two relations can be merged into a single \\nPATIENT relation. However, suppose that there are two different types of patients: \\ninpatients and outpatients. PATIENT1 actually contains attributes common to all \\n patients. PATIENT2 contains an attribute (Room_Number) that is a characteristic \\nonly of inpatients. In this situation, you should create class/subclass relationships for \\nthese entities:\\nPATIENT(Patient_ID,Name,Address)\\nINPATIENT(Patient_ID,Room_Number)\\nOUTPATIENT(Patient_ID,Date_Treated)\\nlOgiCal Database Design FOR \\nHOOsieR\\xa0buRgeR\\nFigure 9-14 shows an E-R diagram that has been developed for a new inventory  control \\nsystem at Hoosier Burger.

Given the attributes shown in \\nFigure\\xa09-14, we can represent these entities in the following four relations:\\nSALE(Receipt_Number,Sale_Date)\\nPRODUCT(Product_ID,Product_Description)\\nINVOICE(Vendor_ID,Invoice_Number,Invoice_Date,Paid?)\\nINVENTORY ITEM(Item_Number,Item_Description,Quantity_in_\\nStock,Minimum_Order_Quantity,Type_of_Item)\\nThe entities ITEM SALE and INVOICE ITEM as well as the associative entity \\nRECIPE each have a composite primary key taken from the entities to which they \\nrelate, so we can represent these three entities in the following three relations:\\nITEM SALE(Receipt_Number,Product_ID,Quantity_Sold)\\nINVOICE ITEM (Vendor_ID,Invoice_Number,Item_Number,Quantity_Added)\\nRECIPE(Product_ID,Item_Number,Quantity_Used)\\nBecause there are no many-to-many, one-to-one, or unary relationships, we \\nhave now represented all the entities and relationships from the E-R model. Also, \\neach of the above relations is in 3NF because all attributes are simple, all nonkeys are \\nfully dependent on the whole key, and there are no dependencies between nonkeys \\nin the INVOICE and INVENTORY ITEM relations.\\nNow suppose that Bob Mellankamp wanted an additional report that was not \\npreviously known by the analyst who designed the inventory control system for \\nHoosier Burger.

In this report, \\nthe same type of item may appear many times if multiple vendors supply the same \\ntype of item.\\nThis report contains data about several relations already known to the analyst, \\nincluding the following:\\n•\\t INVOICE(Vendor_ID,Invoice_Number,Invoice_Date): Primary keys and the date \\nare needed to select invoices in the specified month of the report.\\n•\\t INVENTORY ITEM(Item_Number,Type_of_Item): Primary key and a nonkey in \\nthe report.\\n•\\t INVOICE ITEM (Vendor_ID,Invoice_Number,Item_Number,Quantity_Added): \\nPrimary keys and the raw quantity of items invoiced that are subtotaled by vendor \\nand type of item in the report.\\nIn addition, the report includes a new attribute—Vendor_Name. After some in-\\nvestigation, an analyst determines that Vendor_ID S Vendor_Name. The whole pri-\\nmary key of the INVOICE relation is Vendor_ID and Invoice_Number, so if Vendor_\\nName were part of the INVOICE relation, this relation would violate the 3NF rule. \\nThus, a new VENDOR relation must be created as follows:\\nVENDOR(Vendor_ID,Vendor_Name)\\nNow, Vendor_ID not only is part of the primary key of INVOICE but also is a \\nforeign key referencing the VENDOR relation. Hence, there must be a one-to-many \\nrelationship from VENDOR to INVOICE. The systems analyst determines that an \\ninvoice must come from a vendor, and there is no need to keep data about a vendor \\nunless the vendor invoices Hoosier Burger.

An attribute from a \\nlogical database model may be represented by several fields.

The bit pattern of the coding scheme is usually immaterial to you, \\nbut the space to store data and the speed required to access data are of consequence \\nin the physical file and database design. The specific file or database management \\nsoftware you use with your system will dictate which choices are available to you. For \\nexample, Table 9-2 lists the most commonly used data types available in Oracle 10g.\\nSelecting a data type balances four objectives that will vary in degree of impor -\\ntance depending on the application:\\n1. Minimize storage space\\n2. Represent all possible values of the field\\n3. Improve data integrity for the field\\n4. Support all data manipulations desired on the field\\nYou want to choose a data type for a field that minimizes space, represents every \\npossible legitimate value for the associated attribute, and allows the data to be \\n manipulated as needed. For example, suppose a quantity sold field can be repre-\\nsented by a Number data type. You would select a length for this field that would \\nhandle the maximum value, plus some room for growth of the business. Further, the \\nNumber data type will restrict users from entering inappropriate values (text), but it \\ndoes allow negative numbers (if this is a problem, application code or form design \\nmay be required to restrict the values to positive ones).\\nBe careful—the data type must be suitable for the life of the application; other-\\nwise, maintenance will be required. Choose data types for future needs by anticipat-\\ning growth. Also, be careful that date arithmetic can be done so that dates can be \\nsubtracted or time periods can be added to or subtracted from a date.\\nSeveral other capabilities of data types may be available with some database \\ntechnologies. We discuss a few of the most common of these features next: calculated \\nfields and coding and compression techniques.\\nData type\\nA coding scheme recognized by system \\nsoftware for representing organizational \\ndata.\\nTable 9-2  Commonly Used Data Types in Oracle 10g\\nData Type Description\\nVARCHAR2 Variable-length character data with a maximum length of 4000 characters; \\nyou must enter a maximum field length (e.g., VARCHAR2(30) for a field with \\na maximum length of 30 characters).

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\ASUS\\\\Desktop\\\\AI powered chatbot\\\\Data\\\\SAD.pdf', 'page': 357}, page_content=' ChaPter 9   Designing Databases 333\\nCalculated Fields  It is common for an attribute to be mathematically related to \\nother data. For example, an invoice may include a total due field, which repre-\\nsents the sum of the amount due on each item on the invoice. A field that can be \\n derived from other database fields is called a calculated field (or a computed field \\nor a  derived field). Recall that a functional dependency between attributes does not \\nimply a calculated field. Some database technologies allow you to explicitly define \\ncalculated fields along with other raw data fields. If you specify a field as calculated, \\nyou would then usually be prompted to enter the formula for the calculation; the for-\\nmula can involve other fields from the same record and possibly fields from  records \\nin related files. The database technology will either store the calculated value or com-\\npute it when requested.\\nCoding and Compression Techniques  Some attributes have very few values from \\na large range of possible values. For example, suppose that each product from PVF \\nhas a finish attribute, with possible values of Birch, Walnut, Oak, and so forth. To \\nstore this attribute as text might require 12, 15, or even 20 bytes to represent the \\nlongest finish value. Suppose that even a liberal estimate is that PVF will never have \\nmore than 25 finishes. Thus, a single alphabetic or alphanumeric character would be \\nmore than sufficient. We not only reduce storage space but also increase integrity (by \\nrestricting input to only a few values), which helps to achieve two of the physical file \\nand database design goals. Codes also have disadvantages. If used in system inputs \\nand outputs, they can be more difficult for users to remember, and programs must \\nbe written to decode fields if codes will not be displayed.\\nControlling Data integrity\\nAccurate data are essential for compliance with new national and international reg-\\nulations, such as Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) and Basel II. COBIT (Control Objectives \\nfor Information and Related Technologies) and ITIL (IT Infrastructure Library) \\nprovide standards, guidelines, and rules for corporate governance, risk assessment, \\nsecurity, and controls of data. These preventive controls are best and consistently \\napplied if designed into the database and enforced by the database management \\nsystem (DBMS). Data integrity controls can be viewed very positively during audits \\nfor compliance with regulations. These controls are only as good as the underlying \\nfield data controls.\\nWe have already explained that data typing helps control data integrity by lim-\\niting the possible range of values for a field. There are additional physical file and \\ndatabase design options you might use to ensure higher-quality data. Although these \\ncontrols can be imposed within application programs, it is better to include these \\nas part of the file and database definitions so that the controls are guaranteed to \\nbe\\xa0 applied all the time as well as uniformly for all programs. There are four popular \\ndata integrity control methods: default value, range control, referential integrity, and \\nnull value control.\\n•\\t Default value. A default value is the value a field will assume unless an explicit \\nvalue is entered for the field. For example, the city and state of most customers \\nfor a particular retail store will likely be the same as the store’s city and state. \\nAssigning a default value to a field can reduce data entry time (the field can sim-\\nply be skipped during data entry) and data entry errors, such as typing IM instead \\nof IN for Indiana.\\n•\\t Range control. Both numeric and alphabetic data may have a limited set of permis-\\nsible values. For example, a field for the number of product units sold may have a \\nlower bound of zero, and a field that represents the month of a product sale may \\nbe limited to the values JAN, FEB, and so forth.\\n•\\t Referential integrity. As noted earlier in this chapter, the most common  example \\nof referential integrity is cross-referencing between relations. For example, \\nCalculated field\\nA field that can be derived from other \\ndatabase fields. Also known as a \\ncomputed field or a derived field.\\nDefault value\\nA value a field will assume unless an \\nexplicit value is entered for that field.'),\n",

In this case, the values for the \\n foreign key Customer_ID field within a customer order must be limited to the \\nset of Customer_ID values from the CUSTOMER relation; we would not want \\nto accept an order for a nonexisting or unknown customer. Referential  integrity \\nmay be  useful in other instances. Consider the employee relation  example \\nin Figure 9-17b. In this example, the EMPLOYEE relation has a field of \\nSupervisor_ID. This field refers to the Employee_ID of the employee’s supervisor \\nand should have  referential integrity on the Employee_ID field within the same \\nrelation. Note in this case that the value of a Supervisor_ID field may be empty \\nbecause some employees do not have supervisors; therefore, this is a weak refer-\\nential  integrity constraint.\\n•\\t Null value control. A null value is a special field value, distinct from a zero, \\nblank, or any other value, that indicates that the value for the field is missing \\nor otherwise unknown. It is not uncommon that when it is time to enter data—\\nfor example, a new customer—you might not know the customer’s phone \\nnumber. The question is whether a customer, to be valid, must have a value \\nfor this field. The answer for this field is probably no, initially, because most \\ndata processing can continue without knowing the customer’s phone number. \\nLater, a null value may not be allowed when you are ready to ship a product \\nto the customer. On the other hand, you must always know a value for the \\nCustomer_ID field. Due to referential integrity, you cannot enter any customer \\norders for this new customer without knowing an existing Customer_ID value, \\nand customer name is essential for visual verification of correct data entry. \\nBesides using a special null value when a field is missing its value, you can also \\nestimate the value, produce a report indicating rows of tables with critical miss-\\ning values, or determine whether the missing value matters when computing \\nneeded information.\\nDesigning Physical tables\\nA relational database is a set of related tables (tables are related by foreign keys ref-\\nerencing primary keys). In logical database design, you grouped into a relation those \\nattributes that concern some unifying, normalized business concept, such as a cus-\\ntomer, product, or employee. In contrast, a physical table is a named set of rows and \\ncolumns that specifies the fields in each row of the table. A physical table may or may \\nnot correspond to one relation. Whereas normalized relations possess properties of \\nwell-structured relations, the design of a physical table has two goals different from \\nthose of normalization: efficient use of secondary storage and data processing speed.\\nThe efficient use of secondary storage (disk space) relates to how data are \\nloaded on disks.

For \\nmany information systems, this even division is very difficult to achieve because it\\xa0de-\\npends on factors, such as operating system parameters, outside the control of each \\ndatabase. Consequently, we do not discuss this factor of physical table design in this \\ntext.\\nA second and often more important consideration when selecting a physi-\\ncal table design is efficient data processing. Data are most efficiently processed \\nwhen they are stored close to one another in secondary memory, thus minimizing \\nthe number of input/output (I/O) operations that must be performed. Typically, \\nthe data in one physical table (all the rows and fields in those rows) are stored \\nclose together on disk. Denormalization is the process of splitting or combin-\\ning  normalized relations into physical tables based on affinity of use of rows and \\nfields. In Figure 9-18a, a normalized product relation is split into separate physi-\\ncal tables, each containing only engineering, accounting, or marketing product \\ndata; the primary key must be included in each table. Note that the Description \\nand Color attributes are repeated in both the engineering and marketing tables \\nbecause these attributes relate to both kinds of data. In Figure 9-18b, a customer \\nrelation is denormalized by putting rows from different geographic regions into \\nseparate tables. In both cases, the goal is to create tables that contain only the data \\nused together in programs. By placing data used together close to one another \\non disk, the number of disk I/O operations to retrieve all the data needed by a \\nprogram is minimized.\\nThe capability to split a table into separate sections, often called partitioning, is \\npossible with most relational database products. With Oracle, there are three types \\nof table partitioning:\\n1. Range partitioning. Partitions are defined by nonoverlapping ranges of values for \\na specified attribute (so separate tables are formed of the rows whose specified \\nattribute values fall in indicated ranges).\\n2. Hash partitioning. A table row is assigned to a partition by an algorithm and then \\nmaps the specified attribute value to a partition.\\n3. Composite partitioning. Combines range and hash partitioning by first segregating \\ndata by ranges on the designated attribute, and then within each of these parti-\\ntions, it further partitions by hashing on the designated attribute.\\nEach partition is stored in a separate contiguous section of disk space, which \\nOracle calls a tablespace.\\nDenormalization can increase the chance of errors and inconsistencies that nor-\\nmalization avoided. Further, denormalization optimizes certain data processing activi-\\nties at the expense of others, so if the frequencies of different processing  activities \\nchange, the benefits of denormalization may no longer exist (Hoffer et al., 2016).\\nVarious forms of denormalization, which involves combining data from several \\nnormalized tables, can be done, but there are no hard-and-fast rules for deciding \\nwhen to denormalize data. Here are three common situations (Microsoft, 2015) in \\nwhich denormalization across tables often makes accessing related data faster (see \\nFigure 9-19 for illustrations):\\n1. Two entities with a one-to-one relationship. Figure 9-19a shows student data with \\no ptional data from a standard scholarship application that a student may \\ncomplete. In this case, one record could be formed with four fields from the \\n STUDENT and SCHOLARSHIP APPLICATION FORM normalized relations. \\n(Note: In this case, fields from the optional entity must have null values allowed.)\\n2. A many-to-many relationship (associative entity) with nonkey attributes.  Figure 9-19b \\nshows price quotes for different items from different vendors. In this case, fields \\nfrom ITEM and PRICE QUOTE relations might be combined into one physical \\ntable to avoid having to combine all three tables together. (Note: This may cre-\\nate considerable duplication of data—in the example, the ITEM fields, such as \\nDenormalization\\nThe process of splitting or combining \\nnormalized relations into physical tables \\nbased on affinity of use of rows and fields.'),\n",

Reference data. Figure 9-19c shows that several ITEMs have the same STORAGE \\nINSTRUCTIONS and that STORAGE INSTRUCTIONS relate only to ITEMs. In \\nthis case, the storage instruction data could be stored in the ITEM table, thus \\nreducing the number of tables to access but also creating redundancy and the \\npotential for extra data maintenance.\\nNormalized Product Relation \\nProduct(Product_ID,Description,Drawing_Number,Weight,Color,Unit_Cost,\\nBurden_Rate,Price,Product_Manager)\\nDenormalized Functional Area Product Relations for Tables \\nEngineering: E_Product(Product_ID,Description,Drawing_Number,Weight,Color) \\nAccounting: A_Product(Product_ID,Unit_Cost,Burden_Rate) \\nMarketing: M_Product(Product_ID,Description,Color,Price,Product_Manager)\\nCustomer_ID Name Region Annual_Sales\\n1256 Rogers Atlantic 10,000\\n2566 Bailey Atlantic 12,000\\nA_CUSTOMER\\nCustomer_ID Name Region Annual_Sales\\n1256 Rogers Atlantic 10,000\\n1323 Temple Paciﬁc 20,000\\n1455 Gates South 15,000\\n1626 Hope Paciﬁc 22,000\\n2433 Bates South 14,000\\n2566 Bailey Atlantic 12,000\\nCUSTOMER\\nNormalized Customer Table\\nDenormalized Regional Customer Tables\\nCustomer_ID Name Region Annual_Sales\\n1323 Temple Paciﬁc 20,000\\n1626 Hope Paciﬁc 22,000\\nP_CUSTOMER\\nCustomer_ID Name Region Annual_Sales\\n1455 Gates South 15,000\\n2433 Bates South 14,000\\nS_CUSTOMER\\nFigure 9-18 \\nExamples of denormalization\\n(a) Denormalization by columns\\n(b) Denormalization by rows'),\n",

With some database technologies, the systems \\ndesigner can choose from among several organizations for a file.\\nIf the database designer has a choice, he or she chooses a file organization for \\na specific file that will provide the following:\\n1. Fast data retrieval\\n2. High throughput for processing transactions\\n3. Efficient use of storage space\\n4. Protection from failures or data loss\\n5. Minimal need for reorganization\\n6. Accommodation of growth\\n7. Security from unauthorized use\\nOften these objectives conflict, and you must select an organization for each file \\nthat provides a reasonable balance among the criteria within the resources available.\\nTo achieve these objectives, many file organizations use a pointer. A pointer is \\na field of data that can be used to locate a related field or row of data. In most cases, \\na pointer contains the address of the associated data, which has no business mean-\\ning. Pointers are used in file organizations when it is not possible to store related \\ndata next to each other. Because this is often the case, pointers are common. In \\nmost cases, fortunately, pointers are hidden from a programmer. Because a database \\ndesigner may need to decide if and how to use pointers, however, we introduce the \\nconcept here.\\nLiterally hundreds of different file organizations and variations have been cre-\\nated, but we outline the basics of three families of file organizations used in most \\nfile management environments: sequential, indexed, and hashed, as illustrated in \\nFigure\\xa09-20. You need to understand the particular variations of each method avail-\\nable in the environment for which you are designing files.\\nSequential File Organizations In a sequential file organization, the rows in the file \\nare stored in sequence according to a primary key value (see Figure 9-20a). To locate \\na particular row, a program must normally scan the file from the beginning until the \\ndesired row is located. A common example of a sequential file is the alphabetic list \\nof persons in the white pages of a phone directory (ignoring any index that may be \\nincluded with the directory). Sequential files are very fast if you want to process rows \\nsequentially, but they are impractical for random row retrievals. Deleting rows can \\ncause wasted space or the need to compress the file. Adding rows requires rewriting \\nthe file, at least from the point of insertion. Updating a row may also require rewrit-\\ning the file, unless the file organization supports rewriting over the updated row only. \\nOnly one sequence can be maintained without duplicating the rows.\\nIndexed File Organizations  In an indexed file organization, the rows are stored \\neither sequentially or nonsequentially, and an index is created that allows the appli-\\ncation software to locate individual rows (see Figure 9-20b). Like a card catalog in a \\nlibrary, an index is a structure that is used to determine the rows in a file that satisfy \\nsome condition. Each entry matches a key value with one or more rows. An index \\ncan point to unique rows (a primary key index, such as on the Product_ID field of a \\nproduct table) or to potentially more than one row. An index that allows each entry \\nto point to more than one record is called a secondary key index. Secondary key in-\\ndexes are important for supporting many reporting requirements and for providing \\nrapid ad hoc data retrieval. An example would be an index on the Finish field of a \\nproduct table.\\nOne of the most powerful capabilities of indexed file organizations is the abil-\\nity to create multiple indexes, similar to the title, author, and subject indexes in a \\nlibrary. Search results from the multiple indexes can be combined very quickly to \\nfind those records with precisely the combination of values sought. The example in \\nFigure 9-20b, typical of many index structures, illustrates that indexes can be built \\nFile organization\\nA technique for physically arranging the \\nrecords of a file.\\nPointer\\nA field of data that can be used to locate a \\nrelated field or row of data.\\nSequential file organization\\nA file organization in which rows in a file \\nare stored in sequence according to a \\nprimary key value.\\nindexed file organization\\nA file organization in which rows are stored \\neither sequentially or nonsequentially, and \\nan index is created that allows software to \\nlocate individual rows.\\nindex\\nA table used to determine the location of \\nrows in a file that satisfy some condition.\\nSecondary key\\nOne or a combination of fields for which \\nmore than one row may have the same \\ncombination of values.'),\n",

For example, to find the record with key \\n“Hoosiers,” the file organization would start at the top index and take the pointer \\nafter the entry P, which points to another index for all keys that begin with the\\xa0letters \\nG through P in the alphabet. Then the software would follow the pointer after\\xa0the H \\nin this index, which represents all those records with keys that begin with the\\xa0letters \\nG through H. Eventually, the search through the indexes either locates the desired \\nrecord or indicates that no such record exists. The reason for storing the data in \\nmany contiguous segments is to allow room for some new data to be inserted in \\n sequence without rearranging all the data.\\nThe main disadvantages to indexed file organizations are the extra space \\n required to store the indexes and the extra time necessary to access and maintain \\nindexes. Usually these disadvantages are more than offset by the advantages. Because \\nthe index is kept in sequential order, both random processing and sequential pro-\\ncessing are practical. Also, because the index is separate from the data, you can build \\nmultiple index structures on the same data file (just as in the library, where there \\nare multiple indexes on author, title, subject, and so forth). With multiple indexes, \\nsoftware may rapidly find records that have compound conditions, such as records of \\nbooks by Tom Clancy on espionage.\\nThe decision of which indexes to create is probably the most important physical \\n database design task for relational database technology, such as Microsoft Access, Oracle, \\nDB2, and similar systems. Indexes can be created for both primary and  secondary keys. \\nWhen using indexes, there is a trade-off between improved performance for retrievals \\nand degrading performance for inserting, deleting, and updating the rows in a file. \\nThus, indexes should be used generously for databases intended  primarily to support \\ndata retrievals, such as for decision support applications. Because they impose addi-\\ntional overhead, indexes should be used judiciously for databases that support transac-\\ntion processing and other applications with heavy updating requirements.\\nHere are some guidelines for choosing indexes for relational databases (Gibson, \\nHughes, and Remington, 1989):\\n1. Specify a unique index for the primary key of each table (file). This selection \\nensures the uniqueness of primary key values and speeds retrieval based on those \\nvalues. Random retrieval based on primary key value is common for answering \\nmultitable queries and for simple data maintenance tasks.\\n2. Specify an index for foreign keys. As in the first guideline, this speeds processing \\nof multitable queries.\\n3. Specify an index for nonkey fields that are referenced in qualification and sort-\\ning commands for the purpose of retrieving data.\\nTo illustrate the use of these rules, consider the following relations for PVF:\\nPRODUCT(Product_Number,Description,Finish,Room,Price)\\nORDER(Order_Number,Product_Number,Quantity)\\nYou would normally specify a unique index for each primary key: Product_\\nNumber in PRODUCT and Order_Number in ORDER. Other indexes would be as-\\nsigned based on how the data are used. For example, suppose that there is a system \\nmodule that requires PRODUCT and PRODUCT_ORDER data for products with a \\nprice below $500, ordered by Product_Number. To speed up this retrieval, you could \\nconsider specifying indexes on the following nonkey attributes:\\n1. Price in PRODUCT because it satisfies rule 3\\n2. Product_Number in ORDER because it satisfies rule 2\\nBecause users may direct a potentially large number of different queries to the \\ndatabase, and especially for a system with a lot of ad hoc queries, you will probably \\nhave to be selective in specifying indexes to support the most common or frequently '),\n",

See Hoffer et al. (2016) for a more thorough discussion of factors and \\nrules of thumb for selecting indexes.\\nHashed File Organizations In a hashed file organization, the location of each row \\nis determined using an algorithm (see Figure 9-20c) that converts a primary key value \\ninto a row address. Although there are several variations of hashed files, in most cases \\nthe rows are located nonsequentially as dictated by the hashing algorithm. Thus, \\n sequential data processing is impractical. On the other hand, retrieval of random \\nrows is very fast. There are issues in the design of hashing file organizations, such as \\nhow to handle two primary keys that translate into the same address, but again, these \\nissues are beyond our scope (see Hoffer et al. [2016] for a thorough discussion).\\nSummary of File Organizations The three families of file organizations—sequen-\\ntial, indexed, and hashed—cover most of the file organizations you will have at your \\ndisposal as you design physical files and databases. Table 9-3 summarizes the compar-\\native features of these file organizations. You can use this table to help choose a file \\norganization by matching the file characteristics and file processing requirements \\nwith the features of the file organization.\\nDesigning Controls for Files\\nTwo of the goals of physical table design mentioned earlier are protection from fail-\\nures or data loss and security from unauthorized use. These goals are achieved pri-\\nmarily by implementing controls on each file. Data integrity controls, a primary type \\nof control, were mentioned earlier in this chapter. Two other important types of con-\\ntrols address file backup and security.\\nIt is almost inevitable that a file will be damaged or lost, due to either software \\nor human errors. When a file is damaged, it must be restored to an accurate and \\nreasonably current condition. A file and database designer has several techniques for \\nfile restoration, including\\n•\\t periodically making a backup copy of a file,\\n•\\t storing a copy of each change to a file in a transaction log or audit trail, or\\n•\\t storing a copy of each row before or after it is changed.\\nHashed file organization\\nA file organization in which the address of \\neach row is determined using an algorithm.\\nTable 9-3  Comparative Features of Sequential, Indexed, and Hashed File Organizations\\nFile Organization\\nFactor Sequential Indexed Hashed\\nStorage space No wasted space No wasted space for data, but extra \\nspace for index\\nExtra space may be needed to \\nallow for addition and deletion \\nof\\xa0records\\nSequential retrieval \\non\\xa0primary key\\nVery fast Moderately fast Impractical\\nRandom retrieval on \\nprimary key\\nImpractical Moderately fast Very fast\\nMultiple key retrieval Possible, but \\nrequires\\xa0scanning whole file\\nVery fast with multiple indexes Not possible\\nDeleting rows Can create wasted space or \\nrequire reorganizing\\nIf space can be dynamically allocated, \\nthis is easy, but requires maintenance \\nof indexes\\nVery easy\\nAdding rows Requires rewriting file If space can be dynamically allocated, \\nthis is easy, but requires maintenance \\nof indexes\\nVery easy, except multiple keys \\nwith\\xa0same address require \\nextra\\xa0work\\nUpdating rows Usually requires rewriting file Easy, but requires maintenance of \\nindexes\\nVery easy'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\ASUS\\\\Desktop\\\\AI powered chatbot\\\\Data\\\\SAD.pdf', 'page': 366}, page_content='342 Part IV   Design\\nFor example, a backup copy of a file and a log of rows after they were changed \\ncan be used to reconstruct a file from a previous state (the backup copy) to its cur -\\nrent values. This process would be necessary if the current file were so damaged that \\nit could not be used. If the current file is operational but inaccurate, then a log of \\nbefore images of rows can be used in reverse order to restore a file to an accurate but \\nprevious condition. Then a log of the transactions can be reapplied to the restored \\nfile to bring it up to current values. It is important that the information system de-\\nsigner make provisions for backup, audit trail, and row image files so that data files \\ncan be rebuilt when errors and damage occur.\\nAn information system designer can build data security into a file by several \\nmeans, including the following:\\n•\\t Coding, or encrypting, the data in the file so that they cannot be read unless the \\nreader knows how to decrypt the stored values.\\n•\\t Requiring data file users to identify themselves by entering user names and pass-\\nwords, and then possibly allowing only certain file activities (read, add, delete, \\nchange) for selected users to selected data in the file.\\n•\\t Prohibiting users from directly manipulating any data in the file, but rather force \\nprograms and users to work with a copy (real or virtual) of the data they need; \\nthe copy contains only the data that users or programs are allowed to manipulate, \\nand the original version of the data will change only after changes to the copy are \\nthoroughly checked for validity.\\nSecurity procedures such as these all add overhead to an information system, so \\nonly necessary controls should be included.\\nPHysiCal Database Design FOR \\nHOOsieR\\xa0buRgeR\\nA set of normalized relations and an associated E-R diagram for Hoosier Burger \\n(Figure 9-16) were presented in the section Logical Database Design for Hoosier \\nBurger earlier in this chapter. The display of a complete design of this database \\nwould require more documentation than space permits in this text, so we illustrate in \\nthis section only a few key decisions from the complete physical database.\\nAs outlined in this chapter, to translate a logical database design into a physical \\ndatabase design, you need to make the following decisions:\\n•\\t Create one or more fields for each attribute and determine a data type for each \\nfield.\\n•\\t For each field, decide if it is calculated; needs to be coded or compressed; must \\nhave a default value or picture; or must have range, referential integrity, or null \\nvalue controls.\\n•\\t For each relation, decide if it should be denormalized to achieve desired process-\\ning efficiencies.\\n•\\t Choose a file organization for each physical file.\\n•\\t Select suitable controls for each file and the database.\\nRemember, the specifications for these decisions are made in physical database \\ndesign, and then the specifications are coded in the implementation phase using the \\ncapabilities of the chosen database technology. These database technology capabilities \\ndetermine what physical database design decisions you need to make. For example, \\nfor Oracle, which we assume is the implementation environment for this illustra-\\ntion, the only choice for file organization is indexed, so the file organization decision \\n becomes which primary and secondary key attributes should be used to build indexes.\\nWe illustrate these physical database design decisions only for the INVOICE \\ntable. The first decision most likely would be whether to denormalize this table. \\nHOOSIER\\nBURGER'),\n",

Because each invoice must have a vendor, and the only additional \\ndata about vendors not in the INVOICE table is the Vendor_Name attribute, \\nthis is a good candidate for denormalization. Because Vendor_Name is not very \\n volatile, repeating Vendor_Name in each invoice for the same vendor will not \\ncause  excessive update maintenance. If Vendor_ Name is often used with other \\ninvoice data when invoice data are displayed, then this would be a good candi-\\ndate for denormalization. So the denormalized relation to be transformed into a \\n physical table is\\nINVOICE(Vendor_ID,Invoice_Number,Invoice_Date,Paid?,Vendor_Name)\\nThe next decision can be what indexes to create. The guidelines presented \\nin this chapter suggest creating an index for the primary key, all foreign keys, \\nand secondary keys used for sorting and qualifications in queries. So we create \\na primary key index on the combined fields Vendor_ID and Invoice_Number. \\nINVOICE has no foreign keys. To determine what fields are used as secondary keys \\nin query sorting and qualification clauses, we would need to know the content of \\nqueries. Also, it would be helpful to know query frequency because indexes do not \\nprovide much performance efficiency for infrequently run queries. For simplicity, \\nsuppose there were only two frequently run queries that reference the INVOICE \\ntable, as follows:\\n1. Display all the data about all unpaid invoices due this week.\\n2. Display all invoices ordered by vendor, show all unpaid invoices first, then all \\npaid invoices, and order the invoices of each category in reverse sequence by \\ninvoice date.\\nIn the first query, both the Paid? and Invoice_Date fields are used for quali-\\nfication. Paid?, however, may not be a good candidate for an index because there \\nare only two values for this field. The systems analyst would need to discover what \\npercentage of invoices on file are unpaid. If this value is more than 10 percent, then \\nan index on Paid? would not likely be helpful. Invoice_Date is a more discriminating \\nfield, so an index on this field would be helpful.\\nIn the second query, Vendor_ID, Paid?, and Invoice_Date are used for sort-\\ning. Vendor_ID and Invoice_Date are discriminating fields (most values occur \\nin less than 10 percent of the rows), so indexes on these fields will be helpful. \\nAssuming less than 10 percent of the invoices on file are unpaid, then it would \\nmake sense to create the following indexes to make these two queries run as \\n efficiently as possible:\\n1. Primary key index: Vendor_ID and Invoice_Number\\n2. Secondary key indexes: Vendor_ID,Invoice_Date, and Paid?\\nWe do not illustrate security and other types of controls because these decisions \\nare very dependent on unique capabilities of the technology and a complex analysis \\nof what data which users have the right to read, modify, add, or delete.\\neleCtROniC COMMeRCe aPPliCatiOn: \\nDesigning Databases\\nLike many other analysis and design activities, designing the database for an Internet-\\nbased electronic commerce application is no different than the process followed \\nwhen designing the database for other types of applications.

In this section, we examine the processes Jim followed when transform-\\ning the conceptual data model for the WebStore into a set of normalized relations.\\nDesigning Databases for Pine Valley Furniture’s Webstore\\nThe first step Jim took when designing the database for the WebStore was to review \\nthe conceptual data model—the E-R diagram—developed during the analysis phase \\nof the SDLC (see Figure 8-22 for a review). Given that there were no associative enti-\\nties—many-to-many relationships—in the diagram, he began by identifying four dis-\\ntinct entity types, which he named\\nCUSTOMER,\\nORDER,\\nINVENTORY, and\\nSHOPPING_CART\\nOnce reacquainted with the conceptual data model, he examined the lists of \\n attributes for each entity. He noted that three types of customers were identified during \\nconceptual data modeling, namely, corporate customers, home office customers, and \\nstudent customers. Yet all were referred to simply as a “customer.” Nonetheless, because \\neach type of customer had some unique information (attributes) that other types of \\ncustomers did not, Jim created three additional entity types, or subtypes, of customers:\\nCORPORATE\\nHOME_OFFICE\\nSTUDENT\\nTable 9-4 lists the common and unique information about each customer type. \\nAs Table 9-4 implies, four separate relations are needed to keep track of customer \\ninformation without having anomalies. The CUSTOMER relation is used to capture \\ncommon attributes, whereas the additional relations are used to capture information \\nunique to each distinct customer type. To identify the type of customer within the \\nCUSTOMER relation easily, a Customer_Type attribute is added to the CUSTOMER \\nrelation. Thus, the CUSTOMER relation consists of\\nCUSTOMER(Customer_ID,Address,Phone,E-mail,Customer_Type).\\nTo link the CUSTOMER relation to each of the separate customer types—\\nCORPORATE, HOME_OFFICE, and STUDENT—all share the same primary key, \\nTable 9-4  Common and Unique Information about each Customer Type\\nCommon Information About ALL Customer Types\\nCorporate Customer Home Office Customer Student Customer\\nCustomer ID Customer ID Customer ID\\nAddress Address Address\\nPhone Number Phone Number Phone Number\\nE-Mail Address E-Mail Address E-Mail Address\\nUnique Information About EACH Customer Type\\nCorporate Customer Home Office Customer Student Customer\\nCorporate Name Customer Name Customer Name\\nShipping Method Corporate Name School\\nBuyer Name Fax Number\\nFax Number'),\n",

The results of this investigation are summa-\\nrized in Table 9-5. As described in Chapter 8, much of the order-related information \\nis captured and tracked within PVF’s Purchasing Fulfillment System. This means that \\nthe ORDER relation does not need to track all the details of the order because the \\nPurchasing Fulfillment System produces a detailed invoice that contains all order \\ndetails such as the list of ordered products, materials used, colors, quantities, and \\nother such information. To access this invoice information, a foreign key, Invoice_\\nID, is included in the ORDER relation. To identify easily which orders belong to a \\nspecific customer, the Customer_ID attribute is also included in ORDER. Two addi-\\ntional attributes, Return_Code and Order_Status, are also included in ORDER. The \\nReturn_Code is used to track the return of an order more easily—or a product within \\nan order—whereas Order_Status is a code used to represent the state of an order as \\nit moves through the purchasing fulfillment process. This results in the following \\nORDER relation:\\nORDER(Order_ID,Invoice_ID,Customer_ID,Return_Code,Order_Status)\\nIn the INVENTORY entity, two attributes—Materials and Colors—could take \\non multiple values but were represented as single attributes. For example, Materials \\nrepresents the range of materials that a particular inventory item could be con-\\nstructed from. Likewise, Colors is used to represent the range of possible product \\ncolors. PVF has a long-established set of codes for representing materials and colors; \\neach of these complex attributes is represented as a single attribute. For example, \\nthe value “A” in the Colors field represents walnut, dark oak, light oak, and natural \\npine, whereas the value “B” represents cherry and walnut. Using this coding scheme, \\nPVF can use a single character code to represent numerous combinations of colors. \\nThis results in the following INVENTORY relation:\\nINVENTORY(Inventory_ID,Name,Description,Size,Weight,Materials,Colors, \\nPrice,Lead_Time)\\nFinally, in addition to Cart_ID, each shopping cart contains the Customer_ID \\nand Inventory_ID attributes so that each item in a cart can be linked to a particular \\nTable 9-5  attributes for Order, Inventory, and Shopping Cart entities\\nOrder Inventory Shopping_Cart\\nOrder_ID (primary key) Inventory_ID (primary key) Cart_ID (primary key)\\nInvoice_ID (foreign key) Name Customer_ID (foreign key)\\nCustomer_ID (foreign key) Description Inventory_ID (foreign key)\\nReturn_Code Size Material\\nOrder_Status Weight Color\\nMaterials Quantity\\nColors\\nPrice\\nLead_Time'),\n",

In other words, both the Customer_ID and \\nInventory_ID attributes are foreign keys in the SHOPPING_CART relation. Recall \\nthat the SHOPPING_CART is temporary and is kept only while a customer is shop-\\nping. When a customer actually places the order, the ORDER relation is created \\nand the line items for the order—the items in the shopping cart—are moved to the \\nPurchase Fulfillment System and stored as part of an invoice. Because we also need \\nto know the selected material, color, and quantity of each item in the SHOPPING_\\nCART, these attributes are included in this relation. This results in the following:\\nSHOPPING_CART(Cart_ID,Customer_ID,Inventory_ID,Material,Color, \\nQuantity)\\nNow that Jim has completed the database design for the WebStore, he has \\nshared all the design information with his project team so that the design can be \\nturned into a working database during implementation. We read more about the \\nWebStore’s implementation in the next chapter.\\nSummary\\nDatabases are defined during the design phase of the sys-\\ntems development life cycle. They are designed usually in \\nparallel with the design of system interfaces. To design a \\ndatabase, a systems analyst must understand the concep-\\ntual database design for the application, usually specified \\nby an E-R diagram, and the data requirements of each sys-\\ntem interface (report, form, screen, etc.). Thus, database \\ndesign is a combination of top-down (driven by an E-R \\ndiagram) and bottom-up (driven by specific information \\nrequirements in system interfaces) processes. Besides data \\nrequirements, systems analysts must also know physical \\ndata characteristics (e.g., length and format), frequency \\nof use of the system interfaces, and the capabilities of \\n database technologies.\\nAn E-R diagram is transformed into normalized rela-\\ntions by following well-defined principles, which are sum-\\nmarized in Table 9-1. For example, each entity becomes \\na relation and each many-to-many relationship or associa-\\ntive entity also becomes a relation. These principles also \\nspecify how to add foreign keys to relations to represent \\none-to-many relationships.\\nSeparate sets of normalized relations are merged (a \\nprocess called view integration) to create a consolidated \\nlogical database design. The different sets of relations \\ncome from the conceptual E-R diagram for the applica-\\ntion, known human system interfaces (reports, screens, \\nforms, etc.), and known or anticipated queries for data \\nthat meet certain qualifications. The result of merging is a \\ncomprehensive, normalized set of relations for the appli-\\ncation. Merging is not simply a mechanical process. A sys-\\ntems analyst must address issues of synonyms, homonyms, \\nand functional dependencies between nonkeys during \\nview integration.\\nFields in the physical database design represent the \\nattributes (columns) of relations in the logical database \\ndesign. Each field must have a data type as well as poten-\\ntially other characteristics such as a coding scheme to sim-\\nplify the storage of business data, a default value, picture \\n(or template) control, range control, referential integrity \\ncontrol, or null value control. A storage format is chosen \\nto balance four objectives: (1) minimize  storage space, \\n(2)\\xa0represent all possible values of the field, (3)\\xa0 improve \\ndata integrity for the field, and (4) support all data \\n manipulations desired on the field.\\nWhereas normalized relations possess properties of \\nwell-structured relations, the design of a physical table \\n attempts to achieve two goals different from those of nor-\\nmalization: efficient use of secondary storage and data \\nprocessing speed. Efficient use of storage means that the \\namount of extra (or overhead) information is minimized. \\nTherefore, sequential file organizations are efficient in \\nthe use of storage because little or no extra information, \\nbesides the meaningful business data, is kept. Data pro-\\ncessing speed is achieved by storing data close together \\nthat are used together and by building extra information \\nin the database, which allows data to be quickly found \\nbased on primary or secondary key values or by sequence.\\nTable 9-3 summarizes the performance character -\\nistics of different types of file organizations. The systems \\nanalyst must decide which performance factors are most \\n important for each application and the associated data-\\nbase. These factors are storage space; sequential retrieval \\nspeed; random row retrieval speed; speed of retrieving \\ndata based on multiple key qualifications; and the speed to \\nperform data maintenance activities of row deletion, addi-\\ntion, and updating.'),\n",

Each index entry contains the key \\nvalue and a pointer to the row that contains that key value. \\nAn index facilitates rapid retrieval to rows for queries that \\ninvolve AND, OR, and NOT qualifications of keys (e.g., all \\nproducts with a maple finish and unit cost greater than \\n$500 or all products in the office furniture product line). \\nWhen using indexes, there is a trade-off between im-\\nproved performance for retrievals and degrading perfor-\\nmance for inserting, deleting, and updating the rows in \\na file. Thus, indexes should be used generously for data-\\nbases intended primarily to support data retrievals, such as \\nfor decision support applications. Because they impose ad-\\nditional overhead, indexes should be used judiciously for \\ndatabases that support transaction processing and other \\napplications with heavy updating requirements.

It was 4 p.m., but Jim was nowhere \\nclose to going home yet. The deadlines he had imposed for \\nthe project were fast approaching. His team was running \\n behind, and he had a lot of work to do over the next week \\nto try to get things back on track. He needed to get some \\n coffee for what was going to be a late night.\\nAs Jim approached the cafeteria, he saw Sanjay Agar -\\nwal and Sam Waterston walking toward him. Sanjay was \\nin charge of systems integration for Petrie, and Sam was \\none of the company’s top interface designers. They were \\nboth on the customer loyalty program team. They were \\nhaving an intense conversation as Jim approached.\\nTo: Stephanie Welch\\nFrom: Xin Zhu & Anton Washington\\nRe: Preliminary physical database design for “No Customer Escapes”\\nDate: June 1, 2013\\nWe were charged with converting the conceptual database designs for the customer loyalty system to physical database designs.  \\n We started with one of the initial ERDs (see PE Figure 8-1), designed at a very high level. The ERD identiﬁed six entities:  \\n Customer, Product, Service, Promotion, Transaction, and Coupon. We discovered that all of these entities are already  \\n deﬁned in Petrie’s existing systems. The only entity not already deﬁned is Coupon. Product and Service are deﬁned as part  \\n of the product database. Promotion is deﬁned as part of the marketing database. Customer and Transaction are deﬁned as  \\n part of the core database.\\nHowever, after considerable consideration, we are not sure if some of these already identiﬁed and deﬁned entities are the same  \\n as those identiﬁed in the preliminary ERD we were given. Speciﬁcally, we have questions about Customer, Transaction  \\n and Promotion.\\nCustomer: The Customer entity is more complex than it appears. There are several ways to think about the instances of this entity.   For example, we can divide Customers into those who shop online and those who shop in the brick-and-mortar stores. And  \\n there is of course some overlap. The biggest distinction between these two groups is that we know the names of (and  \\n other information about) the Customers who shop online, but we may have very little identifying information about those  \\n who shop only in the stores. For example, if an individual shops only at a store and pays only with cash, that individual  \\n meets the deﬁnition of Customer (see PE Table 8-1), but we collect no data on that individual at all. We raise these issues \\n to call attention to the relationship between Customers and members of the customer loyalty program: All members are  \\n Customers, but not all Customers are members. We suggest that the entity called Customer in the preliminary ERD be  \\n renamed ‘Member,’ as we think that is a better name for this entity. We are prepared to map out the table design when this  \\n change is approved.\\nTransaction: Petrie already has a relational table called Transaction, but that applies to all transactions in all stores\\n and online. The customer loyalty program focuses on the transactions of its Members, so the program involves only a subset  \\n of Transactions. We suggest that the ERD be redesigned to take this fact into account, and that what is now called\\n Transaction be renamed ‘Member Transaction.’ The relational tables should then be designed accordingly.\\nPromotion: Petrie already has a relational table called Promotion. Again, the customer loyalty program, while having some interest  \\n in general promotions, focuses primarily on promotions created speciﬁcally for Members of the program. What is called  \\n Promotion in the ERD is really a subset of all of Petrie’s promotions. We recommend a name change to ‘Member Promotion’  \\n with the associated relational table design.\\nFinally, for the Coupon entity, which is new, we note from the ERD that Coupon only has one relationship, and that is with   \\n Customer. As it is a one-to-many relationship, the PK from Customer will be an FK in Coupon. We recommend the \\nfollowing table design: COUPON (Coupon ID,Customer ID, Creation Date, Expiration Date, Value)\\nMEMO\\nPe Figure 9-1 \\nMemo on issues related to physical database design for Petrie Electronic’s customer loyalty program'),\n",

And because information \\ncan be collected and formatted in many ways, gaining an \\nunderstanding of design dos and don’ts and the trade-\\noffs between various formatting options is useful for all \\nsystems analysts.\\nIn the next section, the process of designing forms \\nand reports is briefly described, and we also provide guid-\\nance on the deliverables produced during this process. \\nGuidelines for formatting information are then provided \\nthat serve as the building blocks for designing all forms \\nand reports. We then describe methods for assessing the \\nusability of form and report designs. The chapter con-\\ncludes by examining how to design forms and reports for \\nInternet-based electronic commerce applications.\\nDesigning Forms anD reports\\nThis is the second chapter that focuses on system design \\nwithin the systems development life cycle (see Figure 10-1). \\nIn this chapter, we describe issues related to the design of sys-\\ntem inputs and outputs—forms and reports. In Chapter 11, \\nwe focus on the design of dialogues and interfaces, which \\nare how users interact with systems. Due to the highly re-\\nlated topics and guidelines in these two chapters, they form \\none conceptual body of guidelines and illustrations that \\njointly guide the design of all aspects of system inputs and \\noutputs. In each of these chapters, your objective is to gain \\nan understanding of how you can transform information \\ngathered during analysis into a coherent design. Although \\nall system design issues are related, topics discussed in this \\nchapter on designing forms and reports are especially rela-\\ntive to those in the following chapter—the design of dia-\\nlogues and interfaces.\\nSystem inputs and outputs—forms and reports—\\nwere identified during requirements structuring.

You may have \\ndistributed prototypes of forms and reports that emerged during analysis as a way \\nto confirm requirements with users. Forms and reports are integrally related to \\nvarious diagrams developed during requirements structuring. For example, every \\ninput form will be associated with a data flow entering a process on a data flow \\ndiagram (DFD), and every output form or report will be a data flow produced by \\na process on a DFD. This means that the contents of a form or report correspond \\nto the data elements contained in the associated data flow. Further, the data on all \\nforms and reports must consist of data elements in data stores and on the E-R data \\nmodel for the application, or must be computed from these data elements. (In \\nrare instances, data simply go from system input to system output without being \\nstored within the system.) It is common that, as you design forms and reports, you \\nwill discover flaws in DFDs and E-R diagrams; these diagrams should be updated as \\ndesigns evolve.\\nIf you are unfamiliar with computer-based information systems, it will be helpful \\nto clarify exactly what we mean by a form or report. A form is a business document that \\ncontains some predefined data and often includes some areas where additional data \\nare to be filled in. Most forms have a stylized format and are usually not in a simple row \\nand column format. Examples of business forms are product order forms, employment \\napplications, and class registration sheets. Traditionally, forms have been displayed on \\na paper medium, but today video display technology allows us to duplicate the layout \\nof almost any printed form, including an organizational logo or any graphic, on a \\nvideo display terminal. Forms displayed on a video display may be used for data display \\nor data entry. Additional examples of forms are an electronic spreadsheet, a computer \\nsign-on or menu, and an ATM transaction layout. On the Internet, form interaction is \\nthe standard method of gathering and displaying information when consumers order \\nproducts, request product information, or query account status.\\nA report is a business document that contains only predefined data; it is a passive \\ndocument used solely for reading or viewing. Examples of reports include invoices, \\nweekly sales summaries by region and salesperson, or a pie chart of population by \\nForm\\nA business document that contains some \\npredefined data and may include some \\nareas where additional data are to be \\nfilled in.

We usually think of a report as printed on paper, but \\nit may be printed to a computer file, a visual display screen, or some other medium \\nsuch as microfilm. Often a report has rows and columns of data, but a report may \\nbe of any format—for example, mailing labels. Frequently, the differences between \\na form and a report are subtle. A report is only for reading and often contains data \\nabout multiple unrelated records in a computer file. In contrast, a form typically \\ncontains data from only one record or is based on one record, such as data about \\none customer, one order, or one student. The guidelines for the design of forms and \\nreports are very similar.\\nthe process of Designing Forms and reports\\nDesigning forms and reports is a user-centered activity that typically follows a prototyp-\\ning approach (see Figure 6-7). User-centered design refers to a design approach that \\ninvolves an understanding of the target audience, their tasks and goals, information \\nneeds, experience levels, and so on. So, to begin, you must gain an understanding \\nof the intended user and task objectives by collecting initial requirements during re-\\nquirements determination. During this process, several questions must be answered. \\nThese questions attempt to answer the “who, what, when, where, and how” related \\nto the creation of all forms or reports (see Table 10-2). Gaining an understanding of \\nthese questions is a required first step in the creation of any form or report.\\nFor example, understanding who the users are—their skills and abilities—will \\ngreatly enhance your ability to create an effective design (Lazar, 2004; McCracken et \\nal., 2004; Te’eni et al., 2006). In other words, are your users experienced computer \\nusers or novices? What are the educational level, business background, and task-rel-\\nevant knowledge of each user? Answers to these questions will provide guidance for \\nboth the format and content of your designs. Also, what is the purpose of the form \\nor report? What task will users be performing and what information is needed to \\ncomplete this task? Other questions are also important to consider. Where will the \\nusers be when performing this task? Will users have access to online systems or will \\nthey be in the field? Also, how many people will need to use this form or report? If, \\nTable 10-1  Common Types of business Reports\\nReport Name Description\\nScheduled Reports Reports produced at predefined intervals—daily, weekly, or \\nmonthly—to support the routine informational needs of an \\norganization.\\nKey-Indicator Reports Reports that provide a summary of critical information on a \\nrecurring basis.\\nException Reports Reports that highlight data that are out of the normal operating \\nrange.\\nDrill-Down Reports Reports that provide details behind the summary values on a key- \\nindicator or exception report.\\nAd-hoc Reports Unplanned information requests in which information is gathered \\nto support a nonroutine decision.\\nTable 10-2  Fundamental Questions When Designing Forms and Reports\\n1.

A design for a larger audience, how-\\never, may need to go through a more extensive requirement collection and usability \\nassessment process.\\nAfter collecting the initial requirements, you structure and refine this infor -\\nmation into an initial prototype. Structuring and refining the requirements are \\ncompleted independently of the users, although you may need to occasionally con-\\ntact users in order to clarify some issue overlooked during analysis. Finally, you ask \\nusers to review and evaluate the prototype. After reviewing the prototype, users \\nmay accept the design or request that changes be made. If changes are needed, you \\nwill repeat the construction–evaluate–refinement cycle until the design is accepted. \\nUsually, several iterations of this cycle occur during the design of a single form or \\nreport. As with any prototyping process, you should make sure that these iterations \\noccur rapidly in order to gain the greatest benefits from this design approach.\\nThe initial prototype may be constructed in numerous environments, includ-\\ning Windows, OSX, or, most frequently, for the web. The obvious choice is to employ \\nstandard development tools used within your organization and the target platform \\nfor your system. Often, initial prototypes are simply a series of mock screens that \\nare not working modules or systems. Mock screens can be produced from a word \\nprocessor, computer graphics design package, electronic spreadsheet, or even on \\npaper (Snyder, 2003). This series of mock screens is commonly referred to as a paper \\nprototype. In addition to providing a look and feel that can be assessed, the paper \\nprototype is also used to test content, task flow, and other usability factors. It is im-\\nportant to remember that the focus of this activity is on the design—content, layout, \\nand flow—of forms and reports; of course, you must also consider how specific forms \\nand reports will be implemented. It is fortunate that tools for designing forms and re-\\nports are rapidly evolving, making development faster and easier. In the past, inputs \\nand outputs of all types were typically designed by hand on a coding or layout sheet. \\nFor example, Figure 10-2 shows the layout of a data input form using a coding sheet.\\nAlthough coding sheets are still used, their importance has diminished due \\nto significant changes in system operating environments and the evolution of \\n automated design tools. Prior to the creation of graphical operating environments, \\nfor example, analysts designed many inputs and outputs that were 80 columns \\n(characters) by 25 rows, the standard dimensions for most video displays. These lim-\\nits in screen dimensions are radically different in graphical operating environments \\nsuch as Microsoft’s Windows or the web, where font sizes and screen dimensions \\ncan change from user to user, or from device to device. Consequently, the creation \\nof new tools and development environments was needed to help analysts and pro-\\ngrammers develop these graphical and flexible designs. Increasingly, developers are \\nusing tools that can quickly create screen mockups, referred to as wireframes, to \\nshow the placement of information elements on a screen and the space needed for \\neach element. Wireframe can be used to quickly develop a series of screens so that \\nusers can get a sense of the look and feel of a design, as well as the flow and interac-\\ntion of a series of screens (see Figure 10-3a). Some wireframe development tools, like \\nAxure, can directly generate HTML code for web applications. For non-web applica-\\ntions, developers may build screen prototypes using a development language. For \\nexample, Figure 10-3b shows an example of the same data input form as designed in \\nMicrosoft’s Visual Basic.NET. Note the variety of fonts, sizes, and highlighting that \\nwas used. Given the need for rapid, iterative development when designing forms \\nand reports, tools that seamlessly move prototype designs to functional systems are \\nbecoming standard in most professional development organizations.\\nDeliverables and outcomes\\nEach systems development life cycle (SDLC) phase helps you to construct a system. \\nIn order to move from phase to phase, each activity produces a type of deliverable \\nPaper prototype\\nA series of mock screens that can be used \\nto test content, look, and feel, as well as \\nthe task flow and other usability factors.\\nWireframe\\nA simple design to show the placement of \\ninformation elements on a screen and the \\nspace needed for each element.'),\n",

For example, within the project initiation and \\nplanning phase of the SDLC, the Baseline Project Plan serves as input to many sub-\\nsequent SDLC activities. In the case of designing forms and reports, design specifica-\\ntions are the major deliverables and are inputs to the system implementation phase. \\nDesign specifications have three sections:\\n1. Narrative overview\\n2. Sample design\\n3. Testing and usability assessment\\nThe first section of a design specification contains a general overview of the \\ncharacteristics of the target users, tasks, system, and environmental factors in which \\nthe form or report will be used.

The \\nfinal section of the specification, Figure 10-4c, provides all testing and usability assess-\\nment information. Procedures for assessing designs are described later in this chap-\\nter. Some specification information may be irrelevant when designing some forms \\nand reports. For example, the design of a simple Yes/No selection form may be so \\nstraightforward that no usability assessment is needed. Also, much of the narrative \\noverview may be unnecessary unless intended to highlight some exception that must \\nbe considered during implementation.\\nFormatting Forms anD reports\\nA wide variety of information can be provided to users of information systems, rang-\\ning from text to video to audio. As technology continues to evolve, a greater variety of \\ndata types will be used. Unfortunately, a definitive set of rules for delivering every type \\nof information to users has yet to be defined, and these rules are continuously evolv-\\ning along with the rapid changes in technology. Nonetheless, a large body of human–\\ncomputer interaction research has provided numerous general guidelines for format-\\nting information. Many of these guidelines will undoubtedly apply to the formatting \\nof information on yet-to-be-determined devices. Keep in mind that the mainstay of \\ndesigning usable forms and reports requires your active interaction with users. If this \\nsingle and fundamental activity occurs, it is likely that you will create effective designs.\\nFor example, one of the greatest challenges for designing mobile applications \\nthat run on devices like the iPhone is the human–computer interface (Nielsen and \\nBudiu, 2012). In particular, the small video display of these devices presents signifi-\\ncant challenges for application designers. Nevertheless, as these and other comput-\\ning devices evolve and gain popularity, standard guidelines will emerge to make the \\nprocess of designing interfaces for these devices much less challenging.\\ngeneral Formatting guidelines\\nOver the past several years, industry and academic researchers have investi-\\ngated how the format of information influences individual task performance \\nand perceptions of usability. Through this work, several guidelines for format-\\nting  information have emerged (see Table 10-3). These guidelines reflect some of \\nTable 10-3  General Guidelines for the Design of Forms and Reports\\nMeaningful Titles:\\nClear and specific titles describing content and use of form or report\\nRevision date or code to distinguish a form or report from prior versions\\nCurrent date, which identifies when the form or report was generated\\nValid date, which identifies on what date (or time) the data in the form or report were accurate\\nMeaningful Information:\\nOnly needed information should be displayed\\nInformation should be provided in a manner that is usable without modification\\nBalance the Layout:\\nInformation should be balanced on the screen or page\\nAdequate spacing and margins should be used\\nAll data and entry fields should be clearly labeled\\nDesign an Easy Navigation System:\\nClearly show how to move forward and backward\\nClearly show where you are (e.g., page 1 of 3)\\nNotify user when on the last page of a multipaged sequence'),\n",

The differences between a well-designed \\nform or  report and one that is poorly designed will often be obvious. For example, \\nFigure\\xa010- 5a shows a poorly designed form for viewing the current account bal -\\nance for a PVF customer. Figure 10-5b (page 2 of 2) is a better design that incor -\\nporates several general guidelines from Table 10-3.\\nThe first major difference between the two forms has to do with the title. The \\ntitle on Figure 10-5a is ambiguous, whereas the title on Figure 10-5b clearly and spe-\\ncifically describes the contents of the form. The form in Figure 10-5b also includes \\nthe date on which the form was generated so that, if printed, it will be clear to the \\nreader when this occurred. Figure 10-5a displays information that is extraneous to \\nthe intent of the form—viewing the current account balance—and provides infor -\\nmation that is not in the most useful format for the user. For example, Figure 10-5a \\nVague title\\nDiﬃcult to read: information\\nis packed too tightly \\nNo summary\\nof account activity\\nNo navigation information\\nFiguRe 10-5 \\nContrasting customer information forms \\n(Pine Valley Furniture)\\n(Source: Microsoft Corporation.)\\n(a)\\xa0Poorly designed form'),\n",

The form does not, however, provide the current \\noutstanding balance of the account; a user who desires this information must make \\na manual calculation. The layout of information between the two forms also varies \\nin balance and information density. Gaining an understanding of the skills of the \\nintended system users and the tasks they will be performing is invaluable when con -\\nstructing a form or report. By following these general guidelines, your chances of \\ncreating effective forms and reports will be enhanced. In the next sections, we will \\ndiscuss specific guidelines for highlighting information, using color, displaying text, \\nand presenting numeric tables and lists.\\nHighlighting information\\nAs display technologies continue to improve, a greater variety of methods will be \\navailable to you for highlighting information. Table 10-4 provides a list of the most \\ncommonly used methods for highlighting information. Given this vast array of \\n options, it is more important than ever to consider how highlighting can be used to \\nenhance an output and not prove a distraction.

There are several situations when highlighting can be \\na valuable technique for conveying special information:\\n•\\t Notifying users of errors in data entry or processing\\n•\\t Providing warnings to users regarding possible problems such as unusual data \\nvalues or an unavailable device\\n•\\t Drawing attention to keywords, commands, high-priority messages, and data that \\nhave changed or gone outside normal operating ranges\\nAdditionally, many highlighting techniques can be used singularly or in tan -\\ndem, depending upon the level of emphasis desired by the designer. Figure 10-6 \\nillustrates a form where several types of highlighting are used. In this example, boxes \\nclarify different categories of data, capital letters and different fonts distinguish  labels \\nfrom actual data, and bold is used to draw attention to important data.\\nMuch research has focused on the effects of varying highlighting techniques \\non task performance and user perceptions. A general guideline resulting from this \\nresearch is that highlighting should be used conservatively. For example, blinking \\nand audible tones should be used only to highlight critical information requiring an \\nimmediate response from the user. Once a response is made, these highlights should \\nbe turned off. Additionally, highlighting methods should be consistently used and \\nselected based upon the level of importance of the emphasized information.

For example, some color combina-\\ntions may convey appropriate information on one display configuration but wash out \\nand reduce legibility on another.\\nThe continued evolution of graphical operating environments such as \\nWindows, Macintosh, and the web has provided designers with some standard high-\\nlighting guidelines. However, these guidelines are often quite vague and are continu-\\nously evolving, leaving a great deal of control in the hands of the systems developer. \\nTherefore, in order for organizations to realize the benefits of using standard graphi-\\ncal operating environments—such as reduced user training time and interoperability \\namong systems—you must be disciplined in how you use highlighting.\\nColor versus no Color\\nColor is a powerful tool for the designer in influencing the usability of a system. \\nWhen applied appropriately, color provides many potential benefits to forms and \\nreports, which are summarized in Table 10-5. As the use of color displays became \\nwidely available during the 1980s, a substantial amount of color versus no color \\n research was conducted. The objective of this research was to gain a better under-\\nstanding of the effects of color on human task performance (e.g., see Benbasat, \\nDexter, and Todd, 1986).\\nThe general findings from this research were that the use of color had positive \\neffects on user task performance and perceptions when the user was under time \\nconstraints for the completion of a task. Color was also beneficial for gaining greater \\nunderstanding from a display or chart. An important conclusion from this research \\nwas that color was not universally better than no color. The benefits of color only seem \\nto apply if the information is first provided to the user in the most appropriate presentation \\nformat. That is, if information is most effectively displayed in a bar chart, color can \\nbe used to enhance or supplement the display. If information is displayed in an inap-\\npropriate format, color has little or no effect on improving understanding or task \\nperformance.\\nSeveral problems are associated with using color, also summarized in Table 10-5. \\nMost of these dangers are related more to the technical capabilities of the display and \\nhard-copy devices than misuse. However, color blindness is a particular user issue that \\nis often overlooked in the design of systems; approximately 8 percent of the males in \\nthe European and North American communities have some form of color blindness \\n(Shneiderman et al., 2009). It is recommended that you first design video displays for \\nTable 10-5  benefits and Problems from Using Color\\nBenefits from Using Color:\\nSoothes or strikes the eye.\\nAccents an uninteresting display.\\nFacilitates subtle discriminations in complex displays.\\nEmphasizes the logical organization of information.\\nDraws attention to warnings.\\nEvokes more emotional reactions.\\nProblems from Using Color:\\nColor pairings may wash out or cause problems for some users (e.g., color blindness).\\nResolution may degrade with different displays.\\nColor fidelity may degrade on different displays.\\nPrinting or conversion to other media may not easily translate.\\n(Source: Based on Shneiderman et al., 2009; Benbasat, Dexter, and Todd, 1986.)'),\n",

Shneiderman et al. (2009) also suggest that you limit the number \\nof colors and where they are applied, using color primarily as a tool to assist in the \\nhighlighting and formatting of information.\\nDisplaying text\\nIn business-related systems, textual output is becoming increasingly important \\nas text-based applications such as electronic mail, bulletin boards, and informa-\\ntion services (e.g., Dow Jones) are more widely used. The display and format-\\nting of system help screens, which often contain lengthy textual descriptions and \\nexamples, is one example of textual data that can benefit from following a few \\nsimple guidelines that have emerged from past research. These guidelines appear \\nin Table 10-6. The first guideline is simple: You should display text using common \\nwriting conventions such as mixed uppercase and lowercase letters and appropri-\\nate punctuation. For large blocks of text, if space permits, text should be double-\\nspaced. However, if the text is short, or rarely used, it may be appropriate to use \\nsingle spacing and place a blank line between each paragraph. You should also \\nleft-justify text and use a ragged-right margin—research shows that a ragged-right \\nmargin makes it easier to find the next line of text when reading than when text \\nis both left and right justified.\\nWhen displaying textual information, you should also be careful not to \\n hyphenate words between lines or use obscure abbreviations and acronyms. \\nUsers may not know whether the hyphen is a significant character if it is used \\nto continue words across lines. Information and terminology that are not widely \\n understood by the intended users may significantly influence the usability of the \\nsystem. Thus, you should use abbreviations and acronyms only if they are signifi-\\ncantly shorter than the full text and are commonly known by the intended sys -\\ntem users. Figure\\xa0 10-7 shows two versions of a help screen from an application \\nsystem at PVF. Figure 10-7a shows many violations of the general guidelines for \\ndisplaying text, whereas Figure 10-7b shows the same information but follows the \\ngeneral guidelines for displaying text. Formatting guidelines for the entry of text \\nand  alphanumeric data are also a very important topic.

As with the display \\nof  textual  information, tables and lists can also be greatly enhanced by following \\na few simple guidelines. These are summarized in Table 10-7. You should review \\nthese guidelines and carefully apply them to ensure that your tables and lists are \\nhighly usable.\\nFigure 10-8 displays two versions of a form design from a PVF application sys-\\ntem that displays customer year-to-date transaction information in a table format. \\nFigure 10-8a displays the information without consideration of the guidelines pre-\\nsented in Table 10-7, and Figure 10-8b (only page 2 of 2 is shown) displays this infor-\\nmation after consideration of these guidelines.\\nOne key distinction between these two display forms relates to labeling. The \\ninformation reported in Figure 10-8b has meaningful labels that more clearly \\nstand out as labels compared with the display in Figure 10-8a. Transactions are \\nsorted by date, and numeric data are right justified and aligned by decimal point \\nin Figure 10-8b, which helps to facilitate scanning. Adequate space is left between \\ncolumns, and blank lines are inserted after every five rows in Figure 10-8b to help \\nease the finding and reading of information. Such spacing also provides room for \\nusers to annotate data that catch their attention. Use of the guidelines presented \\nin Table 10-7 helped the analyst to create an easy-to-read layout of the information \\nfor the user.\\nMost of the guidelines in Table 10-7 are rather obvious, but this and other \\ntables serve as a quick reference to validate that your form and report designs will \\nbe usable. It is beyond our scope here to discuss each of these guidelines, but you \\nshould read each carefully and think about why each is appropriate. For example, \\nwhy are labels repeated on subsequent screens and pages (the third guideline in \\nTable 10-7)? One explanation is that pages may be separated or copied and the origi-\\nnal labels will no longer be readily accessible to the reader of the data. Why should \\nlong alphanumeric data (see the last guideline) be broken into small groups? (If you \\nhave a credit card or bank check, look at how your account number is displayed.) \\nOne reason is that the characters will be easier to remember as you read and type \\nthem. Another reason is that there will be a natural and consistent place to pause \\nwhen you speak them over the phone; for example, when you are placing a phone \\norder for products in a catalog.\\nTable 10-7  General Guidelines for Displaying Tables and lists\\nUse Meaningful Labels:\\nAll columns and rows should have meaningful labels.\\nLabels should be separated from other information by using highlighting.\\nRedisplay labels when the data extend beyond a single screen or page.\\nFormatting Columns, Rows, and Text:\\nSort in a meaningful order (e.g., ascending, descending, or alphabetic).\\nPlace a blank line between every five rows in long columns.\\nSimilar information displayed in multiple columns should be sorted vertically (i.e., read from top \\nto bottom, not left to right).\\nColumns should have at least two spaces between them.\\nAllow white space on printed reports for user to write notes.\\nUse a single typeface, except for emphasis.\\nUse same family of typefaces within and across displays and reports.\\nAvoid overly fancy fonts.\\nFormatting Numeric, Textual, and Alphanumeric Data:\\nRight-justify numeric data and align columns by decimal points or other delimiter.\\nLeft-justify textual data.

Nonetheless, you can easily produce a \\nhighly usable report of any type if you carefully and creatively use the formatting \\noptions that are available.\\nassessing UsabiLity\\nThere are many factors to consider when you design forms and reports. The objec-\\ntive for designing forms, reports, and all human–computer interactions is usability. \\nUsability typically refers to the following three characteristics:\\n1. Speed. Can you complete a task efficiently?\\n2. Accuracy. Does the system provide what you expect?\\n3. Satisfaction. Do you like using the system?\\nIn other words, usability means that your designs should assist, not hinder, user \\nperformance. Thus, usability refers to an overall evaluation of how a system performs \\nin supporting a particular user for a particular task. In the remainder of this section, \\nwe describe numerous factors that influence usability and several techniques for as-\\nsessing the usability of a design.\\nUsability success Factors\\nResearch and practical experience have found that design consistency is the key \\ningredient in designing usable systems (Cooper et al., 2014; Krug, 2014; Nielsen \\nand Loranger, 2006; Shneiderman et al., 2009). Consistency significantly influ-\\nences users’ ability to gain proficiency when interacting with a system. Consistency \\nmeans, for example, that titles, error messages, menu options, and other design \\nelements appear in the same place and look the same on all forms and reports. \\nConsistency also means that the same form of highlighting has the same meaning \\neach time it is used and that the system will respond in roughly the same amount \\nof time each time a particular operation is performed. Other important factors \\ninclude efficiency, ease (or understandability), format, and flexibility. Each of \\nthese usability factors, with associated guidelines, is described in more detail in \\nTable 10-9.\\nWhen designing outputs, you must also consider the context in which the screens, \\nforms, and reports will be used. As mentioned, numerous characteristics play an im -\\nportant role in shaping a system’s usability. These characteristics are related to the in-\\ntended users and task being performed in addition to the technological, social, and \\nusability\\nAn overall evaluation of how a system \\nperforms in supporting a particular user for \\na particular task.\\nSales Volume (0000)\\nQuarter\\nNorthwest & Mountain Region\\nFourthThirdSecondFirst\\n30\\n25\\n20\\n15\\n10\\n5\\n0\\nPine Valley Furniture\\nQuarterly Sales Report\\nSalesperson\\nHawthorne\\nBaker\\nHodges\\nFiguRe 10-10 (continued)\\n(b) Bar graph'),\n",

Entry of data should be \\navoided where possible (e.g., computing rather than entering totals).\\nClarity Outputs should be self-explanatory and not require users to remember \\ninformation from prior outputs in order to complete tasks. Labels should \\nbe extensively used, and all scales and units of measure should be \\nclearly indicated.\\nFormat Information format should be consistent between entry and display. \\nFormat should distinguish each piece of data and highlight, not bury, \\nimportant data. Special symbols, such as decimal places, dollar signs, \\nand ± signs, should be used as appropriate.\\nFlexibility Information should be viewed and retrieved in a manner most convenient \\nto the user. For example, users should be given options for the \\nsequence in which to enter or view data and for use of shortcut \\nkeystrokes, and the system should remember where the user stopped \\nduring the last use of the system.\\nTable 10-10 Characteristics for Consideration When Designing Forms and Reports\\nCharacteristic Consideration for Form and Report Design\\nUser Issues related to experience, skills, motivation, education, and personality \\nshould be considered.\\nTask Tasks differ in amount of information that must be obtained from or \\nprovided to the user.

Time to learn simply reflects how long it takes \\nthe average system user to become proficient using the system. Equally important is the \\nextent to which users remember how to use inputs and outputs over time. The man-\\nner in which the processing steps are sequenced and the selection of one set of key -\\nstrokes over others can greatly influence learning time, the user’s task performance, \\nand error rates. For example, the most commonly used functions should be quickly \\naccessed with the fewest number of steps possible (e.g., pressing one key to save your \\nwork). Additionally, the layout of information should be consistent, both within and \\nacross applications, whether the information is delivered on a screen display or on a \\nhard-copy report.\\neLeCtroniC CommerCe appLiCations: \\nDesigning Forms anD reports For pine \\nVaLLey FUrnitUre’s Webstore\\nDesigning the forms and reports for an Internet-based electronic commerce appli-\\ncation is a central and critical design activity. Because this is where a customer will \\ninteract with a company, much care must be put into its design. Like the process \\nfollowed when designing the forms and reports for other types of systems, a prototyp-\\ning design process is most appropriate. Although the techniques and technology for \\nbuilding Internet sites are rapidly evolving, several general design guidelines have \\nemerged. In this section, we examine some of these as they apply to the design of \\nPVF’s WebStore.\\ngeneral guidelines\\nWhen designing forms and reports, there are several errors that are specific to web-\\nsite design. It is unfortunately beyond the scope of this book to critically examine all \\npossible design problems within contemporary websites. Here, we will simply sum-\\nmarize those errors that commonly occur and that are particularly detrimental to \\nthe user’s experience (see Table 10-11). Fortunately, there are numerous excellent \\nsources for learning more about designing useful websites (Ash et al., 2012; Cooper \\net al., 2014; Flanders and Peters, 2002; Johnson, 2007; Krug, 2014; Nielson, 1999; \\nNielsen and Loranger, 2006; Shneiderman et al., 2009; www.nngroup.com; www.web-\\npagesthatsuck.com).\\nDesigning Forms and reports at pine Valley Furniture\\nWhen Jim Woo and the PVF development team focused on designing the forms and re-\\nports (i.e., the “pages”) for the WebStore, they first reviewed many popular electronic \\ncommerce websites. From this review, they established the following design guidelines:\\n•\\t Use lightweight graphics.\\n•\\t Establish forms and data integrity rules.\\n•\\t Use stylesheet-based HTML.\\nIn order to ensure that all team members understood what was meant by each \\nguideline, Jim organized a design briefing to explain how each guideline would be \\nincorporated into the WebStore interface design.\\nMemorability\\nA usability dimension concerned with how \\neasy it is to remember how to accomplish \\na task when revisiting the system after a \\nperiod of time.\\nSatisfaction and aesthetics\\nA usability dimension concerned with how \\nenjoyable a system’s visual appeal is and \\nhow enjoyable the system is to use.'),\n",

A technique that can assist in making \\npages load quickly is the use of lightweight graphics. Lightweight graphics are \\nsmall, simple images that allow a page to load as quickly as possible. “Using light-\\nweight graphics allows pages to load quickly and helps users to reach their final \\nlocation in the site—hopefully the point of purchase area—as quickly as possible. \\nLarge color  images will only be used for displaying detailed product pictures that \\ncustomers explicitly  request to view,” explained Jim. Experienced web designers \\nhave found that customers are not willing to wait at each hop of navigation for a \\npage to load, just so they have to click and wait again. The quick feedback that a \\nwebsite with lightweight graphics can provide will help to keep customers at the \\nWebStore longer.\\nForms and Data integrity rules\\nBecause the goal of the WebStore is to have users place orders for products, all \\nforms that request information should be clearly labeled and provide adequate \\nroom for input. If a specific field requires a specific input format such as a date of \\nbirth or phone number, it must provide a clear example for the user so that data \\nLightweight graphics\\nSmall, simple images that allow a web \\npage to be displayed more quickly.\\nTable 10-11 Common errors When Designing the layout of Web Pages\\nError Recommendation\\nNonstandard Use  \\nof\\xa0GUI Widgets\\nMake sure that when using standard design items, they behave in \\naccordance with major interface design standards. For example, \\nthe rules for radio buttons state that they are used to select one \\nitem among a set of items, that is, not confirmed until “OK’ed” by \\na user. In many websites selecting radio buttons is used as both \\nselection and action.\\nAnything That Looks \\nLike\\xa0Advertising\\nBecause research on web traffic has shown that many users have \\nlearned to stop paying attention to web advertisements, make \\nsure that you avoid designing any legitimate information in a \\nmanner that resembles advertising (e.g., banners, animations, \\npop-ups).\\nBleeding-Edge \\nTechnology\\nMake sure that users don’t need the latest browsers or plug-ins to \\nview your site.\\nScrolling Test and \\nLooping Animations\\nAvoid scrolling text and animations because they are both hard to \\nread and users often equate such content with advertising.\\nNonstandard Link  \\nColors\\nAvoid using nonstandard colors to show links and for showing links \\nthat users have already used; nonstandard colors will confuse the \\nuser and reduce ease of use.\\nOutdated  \\nInformation\\nMake sure your site is continuously updated so that users “feel” that \\nthe site is regularly maintained and updated. Outdated content is \\na sure way to lose credibility.\\nSlow Download  \\nTimes\\nAvoid using large images, lots of images, unnecessary animations, \\nor other time-consuming content that will slow the downloading \\ntime of a page.\\nFixed-Formatted Text Avoid fixed-formatted text that requires users to scroll horizontally to \\nview content or links\\nDisplaying Long Lists \\nas\\xa0Long Pages\\nAvoid requiring users to scroll down a page to view information, \\nespecially navigational controls.

Additionally, the site must clearly designate which fields \\nare optional, which are required, and which have a range of values.\\nJim emphasized, “All of this seems to be overkill, but it makes processing the \\ndata much simpler. Our site will check all data before submitting it to the server for \\nprocessing. This will allow us to provide quicker feedback to the user on any data \\nentry error and eliminate the possibility of writing erroneous data into the perma-\\nnent database. Additionally, we want to provide a disclaimer to reassure our custom-\\ners that the data will be used only for processing orders, that it will never be sold to \\nmarketers, and that it will be kept strictly confidential.”\\nstylesheet-based HtmL\\nWhen Jim talked with the consultants about the WebStore during the analysis \\nphase, they emphasized the advantages of using stylesheet-based HTML He was \\ntold that when displaying individual products, it would be very advantageous to try \\nto have a few “stylesheets” that could be used where appropriate in order to make \\nsure that all pages within the WebStore had the same look and feel. Stylesheets \\ndescribe how information will be presented (i.e., its style). Thus, stylesheet-based \\nHTML design allows the content of a web page to remain separate from the way \\nit is formatted. By separating the content from its formatting information, it is \\nmuch easier to update the look and feel of the website and make sure that all \\npages have a similar appearance. Jim explained, “We need to look for ways to \\nmake the website consistent and easy to update. By using stylesheets, we not only \\nget all the pages looking the same, we can also update the look of the website by \\nmaking changes in a few stylesheets, rather than in hundreds of web pages. For \\nexample, a desk and a filing cabinet are two completely different products. Yet, \\nstylesheets guarantee that their separate pages will be formatted and look the \\nsame way.”\\nStylesheet-based HTML\\nA web design approach that separates \\ncontent from the way in which it is \\nformatted and presented, making ongoing \\nmaintenance easier and site-wide \\nconsistency much higher.\\nSummary\\nThis chapter focused on a primary product of information \\nsystems: forms and reports. As organizations move into \\nmore complex and competitive business environments with \\ngreater diversity in the workforce, the quality of the business \\nprocesses will determine success. One key to designing qual-\\nity business processes is the delivery of the right informa-\\ntion to the right people in the right format at the right time. \\nThe design of forms and reports concentrates on this goal. \\nA major difficulty of this process comes from the great vari-\\nety of information-formatting options available to designers.\\nSpecific guidelines should be followed when design-\\ning forms and reports. These guidelines, proven over years \\nof experience with human–computer interaction, help \\nyou to create professional, usable systems. This chapter \\npresented a variety of guidelines covering the use of titles, \\nlayout of fields, navigation between pages or screens, high-\\nlighting of data, use of color, format of text and numeric \\ndata, appropriate use and layout of tables and graphs, \\navoidance of bias in information display, and achievement \\nof usable forms and reports.\\nForm and report designs are created through a \\nprototyping process. Once created, designs may be \\nstand-alone or integrated into actual working systems. \\nThe purpose, however, is to show users what a form or \\nreport will look like when the system is implemented. \\nThe outcome of this activity is the creation of a specifica-\\ntion document where characteristics of the users, tasks, \\nsystem, and environment are outlined along with each \\nform and report design. Performance testing and us-\\nability assessments may also be included in the design \\nspecification.\\nThe goal of form and report design is usability. \\nUsability means that users can use a form or report quickly, \\naccurately, and with a high level of satisfaction. To be us-\\nable, designs must be consistent, efficient, self-explanatory, \\nwell formatted, and flexible.

Sally Fukuyama, assistant director of market-\\ning, knocked on the slightly open door of Jim Watanabe’s \\noffice. Jim was the project director for the “No Customer \\nEscapes” customer loyalty system for Petrie Electronics.\\n“Yeah, come in,” Jim called.\\n“Hi, Jim,” Sally said, pushing the door open further. “Are \\nyou getting ready to leave?”\\n“Well, I was thinking about it, but something tells me \\nthat I’m probably not leaving any time soon. What’s up?”\\n“I just got an e-mail from John [John Smith, the head of \\nmarketing at Petrie]. He has a whole bunch of reports he \\nwants this system to generate,” Sally replied. She took the \\nstuffed manila folder in her hand and dropped it on Jim’s \\ndesk.\\n“What is all this?” he moaned.\\n“John says all of these reports are absolutely essential. \\nHe says you should be able to generate all of the neces-\\nsary data from the new customer loyalty system.”\\n“It will take forever to work out the specific designs on \\nall of these reports,” Jim said. “I’m going to need a lot of \\nhelp on this.” Jim dropped the folder on his desk.\\n“Sorry, Jim,” Sally said. “I’ll help you tomorrow, but I re-\\nally need to go.”\\n“OK, bye,” Jim said, as Sally left his office.\\nHe opened the folder and started to look at what was \\nthere. Some of the report requirements were more com-\\nplete than others. One of the reports near the top of the \\nheap focused on listing the best customers, based on how \\nmuch they had spent in a particular month. “I’ll start with \\nthis one,” Jim thought. “I think I’ll do a quick design in \\nExcel.”\\nJim worked on the report design for 15 minutes. His first \\ncut is featured in PE Figures 10-1 and 10-2. PE Figure 10-1 \\nshows the high-level summary report, which lists only the \\nnames of the customers, where they are from, and the to-\\ntal they spent during a given month. PE Figure 10-2 shows \\nthe details of what each customer bought.\\n“Well,” Jim thought, “these are certainly practical de-\\nsigns for the reports. They show what John says he wants, \\nbut they sure are ugly. I wonder how I can make them \\nlook better. No time for that now. I have to start work on \\nall of these other report designs. How many are there? A \\nhundred? Sure seems like it. Maybe I can get the interns \\nto work on some of this. It would be good for them.”\\nJim looked over the next suggestion for a report from \\nJohn’s stack of requests.\\nCase Questions\\n 10.43 How would you make the reports in PE Figures \\n10-1 and 10-2 “look better”? After you improve the \\ndesign of the reports, explain why you make the \\nchanges you did.\\n 10.44 What other reports do you think John would ask \\nfor, based on the data that would be available from \\nPetrie’s customer loyalty system?

Interface design focuses on how \\ninformation is provided to and captured from users; dia-\\nlogue design focuses on the sequencing of interface dis-\\nplays. Dialogues are analogous to a conversation  between \\ntwo people. The grammatical rules followed by each per-\\nson during a conversation are analogous to the interface. \\nThus, the design of interfaces and dialogues is the  process \\nof defining the manner in which humans and comput-\\ners exchange information. A good human– computer \\ninterface provides a uniform structure for finding, view-\\ning, and invoking the different  components of a system. \\nThis chapter complements Chapter 10, which addressed \\ndesign guidelines for the content of forms and reports. \\nHere, you will learn about navigation between forms, \\n alternative ways for users to cause forms and  reports to \\nappear, and how to supplement the content of forms and \\nreports with user help and error messages, among other \\ntopics.\\nWe then describe the process of designing interfaces \\nand dialogues and the deliverables produced during this \\nactivity. This is followed by a section that describes in-\\nteraction methods and devices. Next, interface design is \\ndescribed. This discussion focuses on layout design, data \\nentry, providing feedback, and designing help menus. We \\nthen examine techniques for designing human–computer \\ndialogues. Finally, we examine the design of interfaces \\nand dialogues within electronic commerce applications.\\nDesigning interfaces anD \\nDialogues\\nThis is the third chapter that focuses on design within the \\nsystems development life cycle (see Figure 11-1). In Chapter \\n10, you learned about the design of forms and reports. As \\nyou will see, the guidelines for designing forms and reports \\nalso apply to the design of human–computer interfaces.\\nthe Process of Designing interfaces and \\nDialogues\\nSimilar to designing forms and reports, the process of \\n designing interfaces and dialogues is a user-focused \\n activity. This means that you follow a prototyping method-\\nology of iteratively collecting information, constructing a \\nprototype, assessing usability, and making refinements. To \\ndesign usable interfaces and dialogues, you must answer \\nthe same who, what, when, where, and how questions used \\nto guide the design of forms and reports (see Table 10-2). \\nThus, this process parallels that of designing forms and \\nreports (see Lazar, 2004; McCracken et al., 2004).\\n11.4 design human–computer dialogues and \\nunderstand how dialogue diagramming can be \\nused to design dialogues;\\n11.5 design graphical user interfaces; and\\n11.6 discuss guidelines for the design of interfaces and \\ndialogues for Internet-based electronic commerce \\nsystems.\\nLearning Objectives\\nAfter studying this chapter, you should be able to\\n11.1 explain the process of designing interfaces and \\ndialogues and the deliverables for their creation;\\n11.2 contrast and apply several methods for interacting \\nwith a system;\\n11.3 describe and apply the general guidelines for \\ndesigning interfaces and specific guidelines \\nfor layout design, structuring data entry fields, \\nproviding feedback, and system help;\\nDesigning interfaces  \\nand Dialogues11 \\nchapter \\nIntroduction'),\n",

This specification is also similar to the specification \\nproduced for form and report designs—with one exception. Recall that the design \\nspecification document discussed in Chapter 10 had three sections (see Figure 10-4):\\n1. Narrative overview\\n2. Sample design\\n3. Testing and usability assessment\\nFor interface and dialogue designs, one additional subsection is included: a \\nsection outlining the dialogue sequence—the ways a user can move from one display \\nto another. Later in this chapter, you will learn how to design a dialogue sequence by \\nusing dialogue diagramming. An outline for a design specification for interfaces and \\ndialogues is shown in Figure 11-2.\\ninteraction MethoDs anD Devices\\nThe human–computer interface defines the ways in which users interact with an in-\\nformation system. All human–computer interfaces must have an interaction style and \\nuse some hardware device(s) for supporting this interaction. In this section, we de-\\nscribe various interaction methods and guidelines for designing usable interfaces.\\nMethods of interacting\\nWhen designing the user interface, the most fundamental decision you make relates \\nto the methods used to interact with the system. Given that there are numerous ap-\\nproaches for designing the interaction, we briefly provide a review of those most \\ncommonly used. (Readers interested in learning more about interaction methods \\nare encouraged to see the books by Johnson [2007], Seffah and Javahery[2003], \\nShneiderman et al.[2009], and Te’eni et al.[2006].)

We will also describe several devices for interacting, focusing primarily on \\ntheir usability for various interaction activities.\\nCommand Language Interaction  In command language interaction, the user en-\\nters explicit statements to invoke operations within a system. This type of interac-\\ntion requires users to remember command syntax and semantics. For example, to \\nrename a copy of a file called “file.doc” in the current directory as “newfile.doc” at \\nthe command prompt within Linux, you would type:\\n$ cp file.doc newfile.doc\\nCommand language interaction places a substantial burden on the user to \\n remember names, syntax, and operations. Most newer or large-scale systems no lon-\\nger rely entirely on a command language interface. Yet command languages are \\ngood for experienced users, for systems with a limited command set, and for rapid \\ninteraction with the system.\\nA relatively simple application such as a word processor may have hundreds \\nof commands for operations such as saving a file, deleting words, canceling the cur -\\nrent action, finding a specific piece of data, or switching between windows. Some of \\nthe burden of assigning keys to actions has been taken off users’ shoulders through \\nthe development of user interface standards such as those for Apple and Windows-\\nbased systems (Pogue, 2015; Schooley, 2013). For example, Figure 11-3a shows a help \\nscreen from Microsoft Word describing keyboard shortcuts, and Figure 11-3b shows \\nthe same screen for Microsoft PowerPoint. Note how many of the same keys have \\nbeen assigned the same function. Also note that designers still have great flexibility \\nin how they interpret and implement these standards. This means that you still need \\nto pay attention to usability factors and conduct formal assessments of designs.\\nMenu Interaction A significant amount of interface design research has stressed \\nthe importance of a system’s ease of use and understandability. Menu interaction is \\na means by which many designers have accomplished this goal. A menu is simply a \\nlist of options; when an option is selected by the user, a specific command is invoked \\nor another menu is activated. Menus have become the most widely used interface \\nCommand language \\ninteraction\\nA human–computer interaction method \\nwhereby users enter explicit statements into \\na system to invoke operations.\\nMenu interaction\\nA human–computer interaction method in \\nwhich a list of system options is provided \\nand a specific command is invoked by user \\nselection of a menu option.\\nFIgure 11-2 \\nSpecification outline for the design of \\ninterfaces and dialoguesDesign Speciﬁcation\\n1.

The variation of \\ntheir design is most often related to the capabilities of the development environment, \\nthe skills of the developer, and the size and complexity of the system. For smaller and \\nless complex systems with limited system options, you may use a single menu or a lin-\\near sequence of menus. A single menu has obvious advantages over a command lan -\\nguage but may provide little guidance beyond invoking the command. An example \\nof a single menu can be found on the “Tabs” settings under the “Options” menu in \\nthe popular Firefox web browser, as shown in Figure 11-4.\\nFor large and more complex systems, you can use menu hierarchies to provide \\nnavigation between menus. These hierarchies can be simple tree structures or varia -\\ntions wherein children menus have multiple parent menus. Some of these hierarchies \\nmay allow multilevel traversal. Variations as to how menus are arranged can greatly \\ninfluence the usability of a system. For instance, Microsoft has recently deployed its \\n“ribbon menu” system in recent Office products. Figure 11-5 shows a variety of ways \\nin which menus can be structured and traversed. An arc on this diagram signifies the \\nability to move from one menu to another. Although more complex menu structures \\nprovide greater user flexibility, they may also confuse users about exactly where they \\nFIgure 11-3\\nFunction key assignments in Microsoft \\nOffice 2013\\n(Source: Microsoft Corporation.)\\n(a) Help screen from Microsoft Word \\n describing keyboard commands\\n(b) Help screen from Microsoft \\nPowerPoint describing keyboard \\ncommands'),\n",

One is to show a list of commands \\nrelevant to the current cursor position (e.g., delete, clear, copy, or validate current \\nfield). Another is to provide a list of possible values (from a look-up table) to fill in \\nfor the current field. For example, in a customer order form, a list of current custom-\\ners could pop up next to the customer number field so the user can select the correct \\ncustomer without having to know the customer’s identifier. With a drop-down menu, \\nmenus drop down from the top line of the display (Figure 11-6b). Drop-down menus \\nhave become very popular in recent years because they provide consistency in menu \\nlocation and operation among applications and efficiently use display space. Most \\nadvanced operating environments, such as Microsoft Windows or the Apple OSX, \\nprovide a combination of both pop-up and drop-down menus.\\nWhen designing menus, several general rules should be followed, and these are \\nsummarized in Table 11-1.

Usage properties, for example, in-\\nclude the ability to dim the color of a menu item while a program is running, indicat-\\ning that a function is currently unavailable. Menu-building tools allow a designer to \\nquickly and easily prototype a design that will look exactly as it will in the final system.\\nForm Interaction The premise of form interaction is to allow users to fill in the blanks \\nwhen working with a system. Form interaction is effective for both the input and presen-\\ntation of information. An effectively designed form includes a self-explanatory title and \\nfield headings, has fields organized into logical groupings with distinctive boundaries, \\nprovides default values when practical, displays data in appropriate field lengths, and \\nminimizes the need to scroll windows (Shneiderman and Plaisant, 2004). You saw many \\nother design guidelines for forms in Chapter 10. Form interaction is the most commonly \\nused method for data entry and retrieval in business-based systems. Figure 11-9 shows a \\nform from the Google Advanced Search Engine. Using interactive forms, organizations \\ncan easily provide all types of information to web surfers.\\nObject-Based Interaction  The most common method for implementing object-\\nbased interaction is through the use of icons. Icons are graphic symbols that look like \\nthe processing option they are meant to represent. Users select operations by point-\\ning to the appropriate icon with some type of pointing device. The primary advan-\\ntages to icons are that they take up little screen space and can be quickly understood \\nby most users. An icon may also look like a button that, when selected or depressed, \\ncauses the system to take an action relevant to that form, such as cancel, save, edit a \\nrecord, or ask for help. For example, Figure 11-10 illustrates an icon-based interface \\nwhen setting Options within the Firefox web browser.\\nForm interaction\\nA highly intuitive human–computer \\ninteraction method whereby data fields \\nare formatted in a manner similar to paper-\\nbased forms.\\nObject-based interaction\\nA human–computer interaction method \\nin which symbols are used to represent \\ncommands or functions.\\nIcon\\nGraphical picture that represents specific \\nfunctions within a system.\\nFIgure 11-9 \\nExample of form interaction from the \\nGoogle Advanced Search Engine\\n(Source: Google.)'),\n",

This method of interaction is referred to as \\nnatural language interaction. Presently, natural language interaction is not as viable \\nan interaction style as the other methods presented. Current implementations can \\nbe tedious, frustrating, and time consuming for the user and are often built to accept \\ninput in narrowly constrained domains (e.g., database queries). Natural language \\ninteraction is being applied within both keyboard and voice entry systems.\\nhardware options for system interaction\\nIn addition to the variety of methods used for interacting with a system, there is also \\na growing number of hardware devices employed to support this interaction (see \\nTable 11-2 for a list of interaction devices along with brief descriptions of the typical \\nusage of each).

The results of this research are summarized in \\nTable 11-4. The rows of this table list common user–computer interaction tasks, and \\nthe columns show three criteria for evaluating the usability of the different devices. \\nAfter reviewing these three tables, it should be evident that no device is perfect and \\nthat some are more appropriate for performing some tasks than others.

The first is simple, but it is often violated by designers. To minimize data \\nentry errors and user frustration, never require the user to enter information that is \\nalready available within the system or information that can be easily computed by the \\nsystem. For example, never require the user to enter the current date and time be-\\ncause each of these values can be easily retrieved from the computer system’s internal \\ncalendar and clock.

Within such a system, default values \\nfor fields should be provided whenever appropriate. This means that only in the \\ninstances where the customer pays more or less than the scheduled amount should \\nthe clerk have to enter data into the system. In all other cases, the clerk would simply \\nverify that the check is for the default amount provided by the system and press a \\nsingle key to confirm the receipt of payment.\\nWhen entering data, the user should also not be required to specify the di-\\nmensional units of a particular value. For example, a user should not be required to \\nspecify that an amount is in dollars or that a weight is in tons. Field formatting and \\nthe data entry prompt should make clear the type of data being requested. In other \\nwords, a caption describing the data to be entered should be adjacent to each data \\nfield. Within this caption, it should be clear to the user what type of data is being re-\\nquested.

And you \\ncan use data entry controls to ensure that the proper type of data (alphabetic or nu-\\nmeric, as required) is entered. Data entry controls are discussed next.\\ncontrolling Data input\\nOne objective of interface design is to reduce data entry errors. As data are entered \\ninto an information system, steps must be taken to ensure that the input is valid. As \\na systems analyst, you must anticipate the types of errors users may make and design \\nfeatures into the system’s interfaces to avoid, detect, and correct data entry mistakes. \\nSeveral types of data errors are summarized in Table 11-8. In essence, data errors can \\noccur from appending extra data onto a field, truncating characters off a field, tran-\\nscripting the wrong characters into a field, or transposing one or more characters \\nwithin a field. Systems designers have developed numerous tests and techniques for \\ncatching invalid data before saving or transmission, thus improving the likelihood \\nthat data will be valid (see Table 11-9 for a summary of these techniques). These tests \\nand techniques are often incorporated into both data entry screens and intercom-\\nputer data transfer programs.\\nPractical experience has also found that it is much easier to correct erroneous \\ndata before they are permanently stored in a system. Online systems can notify a user \\nof input problems as data are being entered. When data are processed online as events \\noccur, it is much less likely that data validity errors will occur and not be caught.

Batch processing systems can, \\nhowever, reject invalid inputs and store them in a log file for later resolution.\\nMost of the tests and techniques shown in Table 11-9 are widely used and \\nstraightforward. Some of these tests can be handled by data management technolo-\\ngies, such as a database management system (DBMS), to ensure that they are applied \\nfor all data maintenance operations. If a DBMS cannot perform these tests, then you \\nmust design the tests into program modules. An example of one item that is a bit \\nsophisticated, self-checking digits, is shown in Figure 11-14. The figure provides a \\ndescription and an outline of how to apply the technique as well as a short example. \\nThe example shows how a check digit is added to a field before data entry or trans-\\nfer. Once entered or transferred, the check digit algorithm is again applied to the \\nfield to “check” whether the check digit received obeys the calculation. If it does, it \\nis likely (but not guaranteed because two different values could yield the same check \\ndigit) that no data transmission or entry error occurred. If the transferred value does \\nnot equal the calculated value, then some type of error occurred.\\nIn addition to validating the data values entered into a system, controls must be \\nestablished to verify that all input records are correctly entered and that they are pro-\\ncessed only once. A common method used to enhance the validity of entering batches \\nof data records is to create an audit trail of the entire sequence of data entry, processing, \\nand storage. In such an audit trail, the actual sequence, count, time, source location, \\nhuman operator, and so on are recorded into a separate transaction log in the event of \\na data input or processing error. If an error occurs, corrections can be made by review-\\ning the contents of the log. Detailed logs of data inputs are not only useful for resolving \\nbatch data entry errors and system audits, but they also serve as a powerful method for \\nperforming backup and recovery operations in the case of a catastrophic system failure. \\nThese types of file and database controls are discussed further in Hoffer et al. (2016).\\nProviding feedback\\nWhen talking with a friend, you would be concerned if he or she did not provide you \\nwith feedback by nodding and replying to your questions and comments. Without \\nfeedback, you would be concerned that he or she was not listening, likely resulting in \\na less-than-satisfactory experience.

There are \\nthree types of system feedback:\\n1. Status information\\n2. Prompting cues\\n3. Error or warning messages\\nStatus Information  Providing status information is a simple technique for keep-\\ning users informed of what is going on within a system. For example, relevant status \\ninformation such as displaying the current customer name or time, placing appropri-\\nate titles on a menu or screen, or identifying the number of screens following the \\ncurrent one (e.g., Screen 1 of 3) all provide needed feedback to the user. Providing \\nstatus information during processing operations is especially important if the opera-\\ntion takes longer than a second or two. For example, when opening a file you might \\ndisplay “Please wait while I open the file” or, when performing a large calculation, \\nflash the message “Working … ” to the user. Further, it is important to tell the user \\nthat besides working, the system has accepted the user’s input and that the input \\nwas in the correct form. Sometimes it is important to give the user a chance to ob-\\ntain more feedback. For example, a function key could toggle between showing a \\n“Working … ” message and giving more specific information as each intermediate \\nstep is accomplished. Providing status information will reassure users that nothing is \\nwrong and will make them feel in command of the system, not vice versa.\\nPrompting Cues A second feedback method is to display prompting cues. When \\nprompting the user for information or action, it is useful to be specific in your re-\\nquest. For example, suppose a system prompted users with the following request:\\nREADY FOR INPUT: ___________'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\ASUS\\\\Desktop\\\\AI powered chatbot\\\\Data\\\\SAD.pdf', 'page': 424}, page_content='400 Part IV   Design\\nWith such a prompt, the designer assumes that the user knows exactly what to enter. \\nA better design would be specific in its request, possibly providing an example, default \\nvalues, or formatting information. An improved prompting request might be as follows:\\nEnter the customer account number (123–456–7): ____-____-__\\nErrors and Warning Messages  A final method available to you for providing sys-\\ntem feedback is using error and warning messages. Practical experience has found \\nthat a few simple guidelines can greatly improve their usefulness. First, messages \\nshould be specific and free of error codes and jargon. Additionally, messages should \\nnever scold the user and should attempt to guide the user toward a resolution. For \\nexample, a message might say, “No customer record found for that Customer ID. \\nPlease verify that digits were not transposed.” Messages should be in user, not com-\\nputer, terms. Hence, such terms as end of file, disk I/O error, or write protected may be \\ntoo technical and not helpful for many users. Multiple messages can be useful so that \\na user can get more detailed explanations if wanted or needed. Also, error messages \\nshould appear in roughly the same format and placement each time so that they are \\nrecognized as error messages and not as some other information. Examples of good \\nand bad messages are provided in Table 11-10. Using these guidelines, you will be \\nable to provide useful feedback in your designs. A special type of feedback is answer-\\ning help requests from users. This important topic is described next.\\nProviding help\\nDesigning how to provide help is one of the most important interface design issues \\nyou will face. When designing help, you need to put yourself in the user’s place. \\nWhen accessing help, the user likely does not know what to do next, does not un-\\nderstand what is being requested, or does not know how the requested information \\nneeds to be formatted. A user requesting help is much like a ship in distress sending \\nan SOS. In Table 11-11, we provide our SOS guidelines for the design of system help: \\nsimplicity, organize, and show. Our first guideline, simplicity, suggests that help mes-\\nsages should be short and to the point, and use words that enable understanding. \\nThis leads to our second guideline, organize, which means that help messages should \\nTable 11-10 examples of Poor and Improved error Messages\\nPoor Error Messages Improved Error Messages\\nERROR 56 OPENING FILE The file name you typed was not found.

Practical experience \\nhas found that long paragraphs of text are often difficult for people to understand. \\nA better design organizes lengthy information in a manner that is easier for users to \\ndigest through the use of bulleted and ordered lists.

For exam-\\nple, Table 11-12 lists the range of help available in a popular electronic spreadsheet. \\nMany systems are also designed so that users can vary the level of detail provided. \\nHelp may be provided at the system level, screen or form level, and individual field \\nlevel. The ability to provide field level help is often referred to as “context-sensitive” \\nhelp. For some applications, providing context-sensitive help for all system options \\nis a tremendous undertaking that is virtually a project in itself. If you do decide to \\ndesign an extensive help system with many levels of detail, you must be sure that you \\nknow exactly what the user needs help with, or your efforts may confuse users more \\nthan help them. After leaving a help screen, users should always return to where they \\nwere prior to requesting help. If you follow these simple guidelines, you will likely \\ndesign a highly usable help system.\\nAs with the construction of menus, many programming environments provide \\npowerful tools for designing system help. For example, Microsoft’s HTML Help envi-\\nronment allows you to quickly construct hypertext-based help systems. In this environ-\\nment, you use a text editor to construct help pages that can be easily linked to other \\npages containing related or more specific information. Linkages are created by embed-\\nding special characters into the text document that make words hypertext buttons—\\nthat is, direct linkages—to additional information. HTML Help transforms the text doc-\\nument into a hypertext document. For example, Figure 11-16 shows a hypertext-based \\nTable 11-12 Types of Help\\nType of Help Example of Question\\nHelp on Help How do I get help?\\nHelp on Concepts What is a customer record?\\nHelp on Procedures How do I update a record?\\nHelp on Messages What does “Invalid File Name” mean?\\nHelp on Menus What does “Graphics” mean?\\nHelp on Function Keys What does each Function key do?\\nHelp on Commands How do I use the “Cut” and “Paste” commands?\\nHelp on Words What do “merge” and “sort” mean?\\nFIgure 11-16 \\nHypertext-based help system from Firefox\\n(Source: Mozilla Firefox.)'),\n",

Hypertext-based help systems have become the \\nstandard for most commercial applications. This has occurred for two primary reasons. \\nFirst, standardizing system help across applications eases user training. Second, hyper-\\ntext allows users to selectively access the level of help they need, making it easier to \\nprovide effective help for both novice and experienced users within the same system.\\nDesigning Dialogues\\nThe process of designing the overall sequences that users follow to interact with an \\ninformation system is called dialogue design. A dialogue is the sequence in which in-\\nformation is displayed to and obtained from a user. As the designer, your role is to \\nselect the most appropriate interaction methods and devices (described earlier) and \\nto define the conditions under which information is displayed to and obtained from \\nusers. The dialogue design process consists of three major steps:\\n1. Designing the dialogue sequence\\n2. Building a prototype\\n3. Assessing usability\\nA few general rules that should be followed when designing a dialogue are sum-\\nmarized in Table 11-13. For a dialogue to have high usability, it must be consistent \\nin form, function, and style. All other rules regarding dialogue design are mitigated \\nby the consistency guideline. For example, the effectiveness of how well errors are \\nhandled or feedback is provided will be significantly influenced by consistency in de-\\nsign. If the system does not consistently handle errors, the user will often be at a loss \\nas to why certain things happen.\\nOne example of these guidelines concerns removing data from a database or \\nfile (see the Reversal entry in Table 11-13). It is good practice to display the infor -\\nmation that will be deleted before making a permanent change to the file. For ex-\\nample, if the customer service representative wanted to remove a customer from \\nthe database, the system should ask only for the customer ID in order to retrieve \\nthe correct customer account. Once found, and before allowing the confirmation of \\nthe deletion, the system should display the account information. For actions making \\nDialogue\\nThe sequence of interaction between a user \\nand a system.\\nTable 11-13 Guidelines for the Design of Human–Computer Dialogues\\nGuideline Explanation\\nConsistency Dialogues should be consistent in sequence of actions, keystrokes, and terminology (e.g., the same labels \\nshould be used for the same operations on all screens, and the location of the same information should \\nbe the same on all displays).\\nShortcuts and Sequence Allow advanced users to take shortcuts using special keys (e.g., CTRL-C to copy highlighted text). A \\nnatural sequence of steps should be followed (e.g., enter first name before last name, if appropriate).\\nFeedback Feedback should be provided for every user action (e.g., confirm that a record has been added, rather \\nthan simply putting another blank form on the screen).\\nClosure Dialogues should be logically grouped and have a beginning, middle, and end (e.g., the last in the \\nsequence of screens should indicate that there are no more screens).\\nError Handling All errors should be detected and reported; suggestions on how to proceed should be made (e.g., suggest \\nwhy such errors occur and what user can do to correct the error). Synonyms for certain responses \\nshould be accepted (e.g., accept either “t,” “T,” or “TRUE”).\\nReversal Dialogues should, when possible, allow the user to reverse actions (e.g., undo a deletion); data should \\nnot be deleted without confirmation (e.g., display all the data for a record the user has indicated is to \\nbe deleted).\\nControl Dialogues should make the user (especially an experienced user) feel in control of the system (e.g., \\nprovide a consistent response time at a pace acceptable to the user).\\nEase It should be a simple process for users to enter information and navigate between screens (e.g., provide \\nmeans to move forward, backward, and to specific screens, such as first and last).\\n(Source: Based on Shneiderman et al., 2009.)'),\n",

With this tech-\\nnique, users must confirm their intention twice before being allowed to proceed.\\nDesigning the Dialogue sequence\\nYour first step in dialogue design is to define the sequence. In other words, you \\nmust first gain an understanding of how users might interact with the system. This \\nmeans that you must have a clear understanding of user, task, technological, and \\nenvironmental characteristics when designing dialogues. Suppose that the market-\\ning manager at Pine Valley Furniture (PVF) wants sales and marketing personnel \\nto be able to review the year-to-date transaction activity for any PVF customer. After \\ntalking with the manager, you both agree that a typical dialogue between a user \\nand the Customer Information System for obtaining this information might pro-\\nceed as follows:\\n1. Request to view individual customer information\\n2. Specify the customer of interest\\n3. Select the year-to-date transaction summary display\\n4. Review customer information\\n5. Leave system\\nAs a designer, once you understand how a user wishes to use a system, you can \\nthen transform these activities into a formal dialogue specification.\\nA formal method for designing and representing dialogues is dialogue \\n diagramming. Dialogue diagrams have only one symbol, a box with three sections; \\neach box represents one display (which might be a full screen or a specific form or \\nwindow) within a dialogue (see Figure 11-17). The three sections of the box are used \\nas follows:\\n1. Top: Contains a unique display reference number used by other displays for ref-\\nerencing it.\\n2. Middle: Contains the name or description of the display.\\n3. Bottom: Contains display reference numbers that can be accessed from the cur -\\nrent display.\\nAll lines connecting the boxes within dialogue diagrams are assumed to be bi-\\ndirectional and thus do not need arrowheads to indicate direction. This means that \\nusers are allowed to move forward and backward between adjacent displays. If you \\ndesire only unidirectional flows within a dialogue, arrowheads should be placed on \\none end of the line. Within a dialogue diagram, you can easily represent the sequenc-\\ning of displays, the selection of one display over another, or the repeated use of a \\nsingle display (e.g., a data entry display). These three concepts—sequence, selection, \\nand iteration—are illustrated in Figure 11-18.\\nContinuing with our PVF example, Figure 11-19 shows a partial dialogue dia-\\ngram for processing the marketing manager’s request. In this diagram, the analyst \\nplaced the request to view year-to-date customer information within the context \\nof the overall Customer Information System.

However, for many other systems, it is critical that you \\nbuild prototype displays and then assess the dialogue; this can pay numerous divi-\\ndends later in the systems development life cycle (e.g., it may be easier to implement \\na system or train users on a system they have already seen and used).\\nBuilding prototype displays is often a relatively easy activity if you use graphi-\\ncal development environments such as Microsoft’s Visual Studio.NET. Some systems \\ndevelopment environments include easy-to-use input and output (form, report, or \\nwindow) design utilities. Tools called “prototypers” or “demo builders” allow you \\nto quickly design displays and show how an interface will work within a full sys-\\ntem.

Here, we briefly discuss some of \\nthese issues.\\ngraphical interface Design issues\\nWhen designing GUIs for an operating environment such as Microsoft Windows or \\nthe Apple OSX, numerous factors must be considered. Some factors are common to \\nall GUI environments, whereas others are specific to a single environment. We will \\nnot, however, discuss the subtleties and details of any single environment. Instead, \\nour discussion will focus on a few general truths that experienced designers mention \\nas critical to the design of usable GUIs (Cooper et al., 2014; Krug, 2014; Nielsen and \\nLoranger, 2006; Shneiderman et al., 2009). In most discussions of GUI program-\\nming, two rules repeatedly emerge as composing the first step to becoming an effec-\\ntive GUI designer:\\n1. Become an expert user of the GUI environment.\\n2. Understand the available resources and how they can be used.\\nThe first step should be an obvious one. The greatest strength of designing \\nwithin a standard operating environment is that standards for the behavior of most \\nsystem operations have already been defined. For example, how you cut and paste, \\nset up your default printer, design menus, or assign commands to functions have \\nbeen standardized both within and across applications. This allows experienced users \\nof one GUI-based application to easily learn a new application. Thus, in order to de-\\nsign effective interfaces in such environments, you must first understand how other \\napplications have been designed so that you will adopt the established standards for \\n“look and feel.” Failure to adopt the standard conventions in a given environment \\nwill result in a system that will likely frustrate and confuse users.\\nFIgure 11-20 \\nWireframes are often used for testing \\nusability'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\ASUS\\\\Desktop\\\\AI powered chatbot\\\\Data\\\\SAD.pdf', 'page': 432}, page_content='408 Part IV   Design\\nThe second rule—gaining an understanding of the available resources and how \\nthey can be used—is a much larger undertaking. For example, within Windows you \\ncan use menus, forms, and boxes in many ways. In fact, the flexibility with which \\nthese resources can be used versus the established standards for how most designers \\nactually use these resources makes design especially challenging. For example, you \\nhave the ability to design menus using all uppercase text, putting multiple words \\non the top line of the menu, and other nonstandard conventions. Yet the standards \\nfor menu design require that top-level menu items consist of one word and follow a \\nspecific ordering. Numerous other standards for menu design have also been estab-\\nlished (see Figure 11-21 for illustrations of many of these standards). Failure to fol-\\nlow standard design conventions will likely prove very confusing to users.\\nIn GUIs, information is requested by placing a window (or form) on the vi-\\nsual display screen. Like menu design, forms can also have numerous properties \\nthat can be mixed and matched (see Table 11-14). For example, properties about a \\nform determine whether a form is resizable or movable after being opened. Because \\nproperties define how users can actually work with a form, the effective application \\nof properties is fundamental to gaining usability. This means that, in addition to \\ndesigning the layout of a form, you must also define the “personality” of the form \\nwith its characteristic properties. Fortunately, numerous GUI design tools have been \\ndeveloped that allow you to “visually” design forms and interactively engage proper-\\nties. Interactive GUI design tools have greatly facilitated the design and construction \\nprocess.\\nIn addition to the issues related to interface design, the sequencing of displays \\nturns out to be a bit more challenging in graphical environments.

This \\nprocess can be a bit more challenging due to the GUI’s ability to suspend activities \\n(without resolving a request for information or exiting the application altogether) \\nand switch to another application or task. For example, within Microsoft Word, \\nthe spell-checker executes independently from the general word processor. This \\nmeans that you can easily jump between the spell-checker and word processor \\nwithout exiting either one. Conversely, when selecting the print operation, you \\nmust either initiate printing or abort the request before returning to the word pro-\\ncessor. This is an example of the concept of “modality” described in Table 11-14. \\nThus, Windows-type environments allow you to create forms that either require the \\nuser to resolve a request before proceeding (print example) or selectively choose to \\nresolve a request before proceeding (the spell-checker). Creating dialogues that \\nallow the user to jump from application to application or from module to module \\nwithin a given application requires that you carefully think through the design of \\ndialogues.\\nOne easy way to deal with the complexity of designing advanced GUIs is \\nto require users to always resolve all requests for information before proceed-\\ning. For such designs, the dialogue diagramming technique is an adequate de-\\nsign tool. This, however, would make the system operate in a manner similar to \\na traditional non-GUI environment where the sequencing of displays is tightly \\ncontrolled. The drawback to such an approach would be the failure to capitalize \\non the task-switching capabilities of these environments. Consequently, design-\\ning dialogues in environments where the sequence between displays cannot be \\npredetermined offers significant challenges to the designer.

Although the techniques and technology for building the human \\ninterface for Internet sites is rapidly evolving, several general design guidelines have \\nemerged. In this section, we examine some of these as they apply to the design of \\nPVF’s WebStore.\\ngeneral guidelines\\nOver the years, interaction standards have emerged for virtually all of the commonly \\nused desktop computing environments such as Windows or OSX. However, some in-\\nterface design experts believe that the growth of the web has resulted in a big step \\nbackward for interface design. One problem, as discussed in Chapter 10, is that \\ncountless nonprofessional developers are designing commercial web applications. In \\naddition to this, there are four other important contributing factors (Johnson, 2007):\\n1. The web’s single “click-to-act” method of loading static hypertext documents \\n(i.e., most buttons on the web do not provide click feedback)\\n2. Limited capabilities of most web browsers to support finely grained user \\ninteractivity\\n3. Limited agreed-upon standards for encoding web content and control \\nmechanisms\\n4. Lack of maturity of web scripting and programming languages as well as limita-\\ntions in commonly used web GUI component libraries\\nIn addition to these contributing factors, designers of web interfaces and di-\\nalogues are often guilty of many design errors. Although not inclusive of all pos-\\nsible errors, Table 11-15 summarizes those errors that are particularly troublesome. \\nFortunately, there are numerous excellent sources on how to avoid these and other \\nTable 11-15 Common errors When Designing the Interface and Dialogues of Websites\\nError Description\\nOpening New Browser  \\nWindow\\nAvoid opening a new browser window when a user clicks on a link unless it is clearly marked that \\na new window will be opened; users may not see that a new window has been opened, which \\nwill complicate navigation, especially moving backward.\\nBreaking or Slowing Down the \\nBack Button\\nMake sure users can use the back button to return to prior pages. Avoid opening new browser \\nwindows, using an immediate redirect where, when users click the back button, they are pushed \\nforward to an undesired location, or prevent caching such that each click of the back button \\nrequires a new trip to the server.\\nComplex URLs Avoid overly long and complex URLs because it makes it more difficult for users to understand \\nwhere they are and can cause problems if users want to e-mail page locations to colleagues.\\nOrphan Pages Avoid having pages with no “parent” that can be reached by using a back button; requires users \\nto\\xa0“hack” the end of the URL to get back to some other prior page.\\nScrolling Navigation Pages Avoid placing navigational links below where a page opens because many users may miss these \\nimportant options that are below the opening window.\\nLack of Navigation Support Make sure your pages conform to users’ expectations by providing commonly used icon links \\nsuch as a site logo at the top or other major elements. Also place these elements on pages in a \\nconsistent manner.\\nHidden Links Make sure you leave a border around images that are links, don’t change link colors from normal \\ndefaults, and avoid embedding links within long blocks of text.\\nLinks That Don’t Provide Enough \\nInformation\\nAvoid not turning off link-marking borders so that links clearly show which links users have clicked \\nand which they have not.

They concluded that placing a menu in the \\nsame location on every page will help customers to more quickly become familiar \\nwith the site and therefore more rapidly navigate it.

Cookie crumbs serve two \\nimportant purposes: First, they allow users to navigate to a point previously visited \\nand will ensure that they are not lost. Second, they clearly show users where they have \\nbeen and how far they have gone from home.\\nSummary\\nIn this chapter, our focus was to acquaint you with the process \\nof designing human–computer interfaces and dialogues. It \\nis imperative that you understand the characteristics of vari-\\nous interaction methods (command language, menu, form, \\nobject, natural language) and devices (keyboard, mouse, \\njoystick, trackball, touch screen, light pen, graphics tab-\\nlet, voice). No single interaction style or device is the most \\n appropriate in all instances: Each has its strengths and weak-\\nnesses. You must consider the characteristics of the intended \\nusers, the tasks being performed, and various technical and \\nenvironmental factors when making design decisions.\\nThe chapter also reviewed design guidelines for \\ncomputer-based forms. You learned that most forms have a \\nheader, sequence or time-related information, instructions, \\na body, summary data, authorization, and comments. Users \\nmust be able to move the cursor position, edit data, exit \\nwith different consequences, and obtain help. Techniques \\nfor structuring and controlling data entry were presented \\nalong with guidelines for providing feedback, prompts, \\nand error messages. A simple, well-organized help function \\nthat shows examples of proper use of the system should be \\nprovided. A variety of help types were reviewed.\\nNext, guidelines for designing human–computer di-\\nalogues were presented. These guidelines are consistency, \\nallowing for shortcuts, providing feedback and closure \\non tasks, handling errors, allowing for operations rever-\\nsal, giving the user a sense of control, and ease of naviga-\\ntion. We also discussed dialogue diagramming as a design \\ntool. Assessing the usability of dialogues and procedures \\nwas also reviewed. Several interface and dialogue design is-\\nsues were described within the context of designing GUIs. \\nThese included the need to follow standards to provide \\nthe capabilities of modality, resizing, moving, and maxi-\\nmizing and minimizing windows, and to offer a system \\nmenu choice. This discussion highlighted how concepts \\npresented earlier in this chapter can be applied or aug-\\nmented in these emerging environments. Finally, inter-\\nface and dialogue design issues for Internet-based applica-\\ntions were discussed, and several common design errors \\nwere highlighted.\\nOur goal was to provide you with a foundation for \\nbuilding highly usable human–computer interfaces. As \\nmore and more development environments provide \\nrapid prototyping tools for the design of interfaces and \\ndialogues, many complying with common interface stan-\\ndards, the difficulty of designing usable interfaces will be \\nreduced. However, you still need a solid understanding \\nof the concepts presented in this chapter in order to suc-\\nceed. Learning to use a computer system is like learning \\nto use a parachute—if a person fails on the first try, odds \\nare he or she won’t try again (Blattner and Schultz, 1988). \\nIf this analogy is true, it is important that a user’s first ex-\\nperience with a system be a positive one. By following the \\ndesign guidelines outlined in this chapter, your chances of \\nproviding a positive first experience to users will be greatly \\nenhanced.\\nKey TermS\\n11.1 Command language interaction\\n11.2 Cookie crumbs\\n11.3 Dialogue\\n11.4 Dialogue diagramming\\n11.5 Drop-down menu\\n11.6 Form interaction\\n11.7 Icon\\n11.8 Interface\\n11.9 Menu interaction\\n11.10 Natural language interaction\\n11.11 Object-based interaction\\n11.12 Pop-up menu'),\n",

In this chapter, however, no specific techniques \\nwill be presented on how to represent the design of \\ndistributed and Internet systems because no generally \\n accepted techniques exist. Alternatively, we will focus on \\nincreasing your awareness of common environments for \\ndeploying these systems and the issues you will confront \\nsurrounding their design and implementation.

Because distributed and Internet systems have more components than a \\nsingle-location system—that is, more processors, networks, locations, data, and so \\non—there are more potential places for a failure to occur. Consequently, various \\nstrategies can be used when designing and implementing these systems to minimize \\npoints of failure.\\nThus, when designing distributed and Internet systems, you will need to con-\\nsider numerous trade-offs. To create effective designs, you need to understand the \\ncharacteristics of the architectures commonly used to support these systems.\\nDeliverables and Outcomes\\nWhen designing distributed and Internet systems, the deliverable is a document \\nthat will consolidate the information that must be considered when implementing \\na system design. Figure 12-2 lists the types of information that should be consid-\\nered when implementing such a system. In general, the information that must be \\nconsidered is the site, processing needs, and data information for each location \\n(or processor) in the distributed environment. Specifically, information related \\nto physical distances between locations, counts and usage patterns by users, build-\\ning and location infrastructure issues, personnel capabilities, data usage (create, \\nuse, update, or destroy), and local organizational processes should be described. \\nAdditionally, the pros and cons of various implementation solutions for each loca-\\ntion should be reviewed. The collection of this information, in conjunction with \\nthe physical design information already developed, will provide the basis for imple-\\nmenting the information system in the distributed environment.

The section begins by providing \\na high-level description of both architectures. This is followed by a brief description \\nof advanced client/server designs using middleware to create a more robust system \\ndeployment model.\\nDesigning systems for Lans\\nPersonal computers and workstations can be used as stand-alone systems to support \\nlocal applications. However, organizations have discovered that if data is valuable to \\none employee, it is probably also valuable to other employees in the same workgroup \\nor in other workgroups. By interconnecting their computers, workers can exchange \\ninformation electronically and can also share devices such as printers that may be too \\nexpensive to be utilized by only a single user.\\nA local area network (LAN) supports a network of personal computers, each \\nwith its own storage; each computer is able to share common devices and software \\nattached to the LAN. Each PC and workstation on a LAN is typically within a few hun-\\ndred feet of another, with a total network cable length of less than 1 mile. Usually, \\nat least one computer (a microcomputer or larger) is designated as a file server, on \\nwhich shared databases and applications are stored. The LAN modules of a DBMS, \\nfor example, add concurrent access controls, possibly extra security features, and \\nquery or transaction queuing management to support concurrent access from mul-\\ntiple users of a shared database.\\nFile Servers In a basic LAN environment (see Figure 12-3), all data manipulation \\noccurs at the workstations from which data are requested. One or more file servers \\nare attached to the LAN. A file server is a device that manages file operations and is \\nshared by each client PC that is attached to the LAN.

Programs on your PC refer to files on this drive by the typical \\npath specification, using this drive and any directories, as well as the file name.\\nWhen using a DBMS in a file server environment, each client PC is authorized \\nto use the DBMS application program on that PC. Thus, there is one database on the \\nfile server and many concurrently running copies of the DBMS on each active PC \\nclient. The primary characteristic of a client-based LAN is that all data manipulation \\nis performed at the client PC, not at the file server. The file server acts simply as a \\nshared data storage device and is an extension of a typical PC. It also provides ad-\\nditional resources (e.g., disk drives, shared printing) and collaborative applications \\n(e.g., e-mail) in addition to the shared data. Software at the file server only queues \\naccess requests; it is up to the application program at each client PC, working with \\nthe copy of the DBMS on that PC, to handle all data management functions. This \\nmeans that, in an application that wants to view a single customer account record in \\na database stored on the server, the file containing all customer account records will \\nbe sent over the network to the PC. Once at the PC, the file will be searched to find \\nthe desired record. Additionally, data security checks and file and record locking are \\ndone at the client PCs in this environment, making multiple-user application devel-\\nopment a relatively complex process.\\nLimitations of File Servers There are three primary limitations when using file serv-\\ners on LANs:\\n1. Excessive data movement\\n2. The need for a powerful client workstation\\n3. Decentralized data control\\nFirst, when using a file server architecture, considerable data movement is gen-\\nerated across the network.

Consequently, a client-based LAN places a considerable \\nburden on the client PC to carry out functions that have to be performed on all \\n clients and creates a high network traffic load.\\nSecond, because each client workstation must devote memory to a full ver -\\nsion of the DBMS, there is less room on the client PC to rapidly manipulate data in \\nhigh-speed random access memory (RAM). Often, data must be swapped between \\nRAM and a relatively slower hard disk when processing a particularly large database. \\nFurther, because the client workstation does most of the work, each client must be \\nrather powerful to provide a suitable response time. File server architectures also \\nbenefit from having a very fast hard disk and cache memory in both clients and the \\nserver to enhance their ability to transfer files to and from the network, RAM, and \\nhard disk.\\nThird, and possibly most important, the DBMS copy in each workstation must \\nmanage the shared database integrity. In addition, each application program must \\nrecognize, for example, locks on data and take care to initiate the proper locks. \\nA\\xa0lock is necessary to stop users from accessing data that are in the process of being \\nupdated. Thus, application programmers must be rather sophisticated to understand \\nthe various subtle conditions that can arise in a multiple-user database environment. \\nProgramming in such an environment is complex because you have to program each \\napplication with the proper concurrency, recovery, and security controls.\\nDesigning systems for a Client/server architecture\\nAn improvement in LAN-based systems is the client/server architecture in which \\n application processing is divided (not necessarily evenly) between client and server. \\nThe client workstation is most often responsible for managing the user interface, \\nincluding presenting data, and the database server is responsible for database stor-\\nage and access, such as query processing. The typical client/server architecture is \\nillustrated in Figure 12-5.\\nClient/server architecture\\nA LAN-based computing environment in \\nwhich a central database server or engine \\nperforms all database commands sent to \\nit from client workstations, and application \\nprograms on each client concentrate on \\nuser interface functions.\\nClient\\nServer\\nEntire ﬁle sent to client\\nFile Server Architecture\\nClient request for data\\nFigure 12-4 \\nFile servers transfer files when data are \\nrequested from a client\\nClient\\nServer\\nONLY result of request\\nClient/Server Architecture\\nClient request for data\\nFigure 12-5 \\nThe required data after a request from a \\nclient'),\n",

Some people refer to the central DBMS func-\\ntions as the back-end functions and the client-based delivery of applications to users \\nusing PCs and workstations as the front-end applications. Further, in the client/server \\narchitecture, the server executes all requests for data so that only data that match \\nthe requested criteria are passed across the network to client stations. This is a sig-\\nnificant advantage of client/server over simple file server designs. Because the server \\nprovides all shared database services, this leaves the client software to concentrate on \\nuser interface and data manipulation functions. The trade-off is that the server must \\nbe more powerful than the server in a file server environment.\\nAn application built using the client/server architecture is also different from \\na centralized database system on a mainframe. The primary difference is that each \\nclient is an intelligent part of the application processing system. In other words, the \\napplication program executed by a user is running on the client, not on the server. \\nThe application program handles all interactions with the user and local devices \\n(printer, keyboard, screen, etc.). Thus, there is a division of duties between the server \\n(database engine) and the client. The database engine handles all database access \\nand control functions, and the client handles all user interaction and data manipula-\\ntion functions. The client PC sends database commands to the database engine for \\nprocessing. Alternatively, in a mainframe environment, all parts of the information \\nsystem are managed and executed by the central computer.\\nAnother advantage of client/server architectures is the ability to decouple \\nthe client environment from the server environment. Clients can consist of multi-\\nple types (e.g., different computers, operating systems, and application programs), \\nwhich means that the client can be running any application system that can generate \\nthe proper commands (often SQL) to request data from the server. For  example, the \\napplication program might be written in Visual Basic, a report writer, a sophisticated \\nscreen painter, or any fourth-generation language that has an application program \\ninterface (API) for the database engine. The database engine might be DB2 on an \\nIBM mainframe or midrange computer or MySQL, Sybase, or Oracle running on a \\nvariety of platforms. An API calls library routines that transparently route SQL com-\\nmands from the front-end client application to the database server. An API might \\nwork with existing front-end software, such as a third-generation language or custom \\nreport generator, and it might include its own facilities for building applications. \\nWhen APIs exist for several program development tools, then you have considerable \\nindependence to develop client applications in the most convenient front-end pro-\\ngramming environment, yet still draw from a common server database. With some \\nAPIs, it is possible to access data from both the client and server in one database \\noperation, as if the data were in one location managed by one DBMS (see Hoffer et \\nal., 2016; Kroenke, 2016).\\nIn sum, several significant benefits can be realized by adopting a client/server \\narchitecture:\\n1. It allows companies to leverage the benefits of microcomputer technology. \\n Today’s workstations deliver impressive computing power at a fraction of the cost \\nof a mainframe.\\n2. It allows most processing to be performed close to the source of processed data, \\nthereby improving response times and reducing network traffic.\\n3. It facilitates the use of graphical user interfaces and visual presentation tech-\\nniques commonly available for workstations.\\n4. It allows for and encourages the acceptance of open systems.\\nTable 12-1 summarizes some of the key differences between file server and \\nclient/server architectures.

These variations are based on the concept that there are three \\ngeneral components to any information system:\\n1. Data management. These functions manage all interaction between software and \\nfiles and databases, including data retrieval/querying, updating, security, concur-\\nrency control, and recovery.\\n2. Data presentation. These functions manage just the interface between system \\n users and the software, including the display and printing of forms and reports \\nand possibly validating system inputs.\\n3. Data analysis. These functions transform inputs into outputs, including simple \\nsummarization to complex mathematical modeling such as regression analysis.\\nDifferent client/server architectures distribute, or partition, each of these func-\\ntions, and others (e.g., load balancing), to one or both of the client or server com-\\nputers, and increasingly, into a third computer, referred to as the application server. \\nIn fact, it is becoming commonplace to use three or more distinct computers in many \\nadvanced client/server architectures (see Bass et al., 2012; Marchioni, 2014). It is \\nalso important to note, however, as hardware and software has gotten more powerful \\nand sophisticated, the partitioning of these various functions across separate physical \\ncomputers has decreased. Increasingly, these different features may reside on virtual \\nmachines. A virtual machine is a software emulation of a physical computer system, \\nboth hardware and operating system, that allows more efficient sharing of physical \\nhardware resources. Virtualization, a foundation of modern distributed computing \\narchitectures like cloud computing (see below), refers to the act of creating virtual \\n(rather than physical) versions of a variety of computing capabilities including hard-\\nware platforms, operating systems, storage devices, and networks.\\nThis evolution in client/server computing to separate various functions across \\ndifferent physical or virtual machines, has resulted in two important concepts, three-\\ntiered client/server architecture and middleware, to represent this evolution. Three-\\ntiered client/server architectures allow three logical and distinct functions of a com-\\nputing system—data management, presentation, and analysis—to be developed and \\nmaintained as independent modules that often reside on separate physical or vir-\\ntual machines. Increasingly, an n-tiered architecture is being utilized by many organiza-\\ntions because it enables the development of more flexible and reusable applications. \\nBy segregating a system into multiple tiers, developers can modify an existing tier, \\nor add a completely new tier, rather than reworking the entire system when new \\ncapabilities are needed.

As shown in Figure 12.6.\\nThe easiest way to think of middleware is as plumbing. In your house, you don’t \\nsee plumbing, you see water that fills your glass (DiMaggio, 2008). When interacting \\nwith an information system, you see applications and data. You are clearly aware of \\nthe Web interface that you are using on your PC or smartphone, which is similar to \\nwater; you can see it, feel it, and taste it. You are also likely aware of the databases and \\nsystems that store and provide information to your devices; this would be analogous \\nto the water purification plant (i.e., we know the water [and data] is coming from \\nsomewhere). Further, how the water gets from the plant and into your glass, this is \\nthe plumbing. Likewise, the way in which the information gets to your client device, \\nwhether it be a PC or smartphone, is provided by middleware (i.e., the technological \\nplumbing). Like plumbing components, middleware provides a lot of benefits. First, \\nit remains mostly invisible. It is there, but you don’t usually see it or interact with it \\ntoo much. Second, it provides a standard way to connect devices to applications and \\ndata by using standards, libraries, and APIs. Third, it provides a consistent way to tie \\ntogether various parts of a complex system; like in your home, where you want water \\nto various locations, you also want data to various applications and devices located \\nthroughout an organization or around the world.\\nIn addition to these benefits, there are other good reasons for creating three-\\ntiered (or n-tiered) client/server architectures (Bass et al., 2012). First, applica -\\ntions can be partitioned in a way that best fits organizational computing needs. For \\n example, in a traditional two-tiered client/server system, the application (data analy-\\nsis) resides on the client, which would access information such as customer data from \\na database server. In advanced architectures, data analysis can reside on a powerful \\napplication server, resulting in substantially faster response times for users. In addi -\\ntion, a multi-tiered architecture provides greater flexibility by allowing the partition-\\ning of applications in different ways for different users, thus optimizing performance \\nfor each type of client.\\nA second advantage is that because most or all of the data analysis is contained \\nin the application server, making global changes or customizing processes for indi -\\nvidual users is relatively easy. This allows developers to easily create custom versions \\nof large-scale systems without creating a completely separate system. Also, because \\nthe data analysis is separate from the user interface, it is a lot easier to change one \\nor both without having a major maintenance effort. By separating the data analysis \\nfrom the data presentation (the user interface), either can be changed indepen -\\ndently without affecting the other, greatly simplifying system maintenance. Lastly, \\nServer and\\nApplications\\nServer and\\nApplications\\nServer and\\nApplications\\nMiddleware\\nFigure 12-6 \\nMiddleware ties together diverse \\napplications and devices'),\n",

Thin clients are most appropriate for \\ndoing a minimal amount of client-side processing, essentially displaying informa-\\ntion sent to the client from the server (Robbins, 2013). The combinations of these \\n benefits—application partitioning, easier customization, easier maintenance, and \\ndevice independence—are driving many organizations to adopt this powerful archi-\\ntecture for developing applications.\\nCLOuD COmPuting\\nManaging the information systems infrastructure – the hardware, software, data, \\n facilities, human resources, and services used by organizations to support their deci-\\nsion making, business processes, and competitive strategy – can be a challenge for \\nmany organizations, due to the evolution of hardware and software, the demand for \\nmore storage and networking bandwidth, and the rising costs of energy. Further, \\n organizations need dedicated staff to support their infrastructure, which incurs fur-\\nther costs; often, managing the IS infrastructure is not among the organization’s core \\ncompetencies, so others may be better at managing the infrastructure for them (see \\nValacich and Schneider, 2016).\\nIn many organizations, the IS infrastructure has grown over the years, lead-\\ning to a fragmented infrastructure that tends to be difficult to consolidate. However, \\n efficiency, effectiveness, and agility are key for successfully competing in the digital \\nworld, and organizations require a flexible, scalable infrastructure for their applica-\\ntions and databases. As a result, over the past decades, there has been a shift away \\nfrom thinking about developing and maintaining the IS infrastructure toward think-\\ning about what services the infrastructure should deliver. For example, people and \\norganizations want to use e-mail rather than having to think about purchasing an \\ne-mail server and dealing with associated issues such as administration, maintenance, \\nstorage, energy consumption, and so on. In addition, organizations increasingly buy \\nor rent, rather than build, applications (except for highly specialized systems that \\nhelp gain or sustain competitive advantage, as is the case with Amazon.com or Dell) \\nto support their business processes; in other words, organizations leave the building \\nand managing of applications to other parties, and assume that these applications \\nwill work. Given this trend, a solid infrastructure is important, as the infrastructure \\ndetermines how quickly new systems can be implemented, and how well they will \\nfunction; turning over the responsibility for the lower levels of the infrastructure to \\nother organizations allows a business to focus on developing and implementing those \\napplications that help to gain or sustain competitive advantage. This becomes even \\nmore important as any lack of robustness or integration of an organization’s infra-\\nstructure will be immediately noticed by customers or other stakeholders,  potentially \\nleading to loss of business, trust, or goodwill.\\nWhat is Cloud Computing?\\nTechnological advances such as faster processing, increasing Internet bandwidth, \\n improving data management and processing frameworks like Hadoop and Bigtable, \\nas well as improving methods for virtualization, have given rise to cloud  computing \\n(the “cloud” is a metaphor for the Internet; see Figure 12-7). As introduced in \\nChapter 2, cloud computing refers to the provision of applications over the Internet \\nwhere customers do not have to invest in the hardware and software resources \\nneeded to run and maintain the applications, but are charged on a per-use basis (see \\nErl et al., 2013). Cloud computing is a utility computing model (i.e., organizations \\n“renting” resources such as processing, data storage, or networking from an exter-\\nnal provider on an as-needed basis, and pay only for what is actually used).

One prime example of a cloud \\ncomputing provider is Amazon Web Services (AWS); having built an immense infra -\\nstructure (in terms of both information technology and logistics) for supporting its \\nonline store, Amazon.com has decided to use these resources to generate additional \\nrevenue streams. For example, individuals and organizations can rent storage space \\non Amazon’s Simple Storage Service (S3) or computing time on Amazon’s Elastic \\nCompute Cloud (EC2), all on an as-needed basis. The ability to create an entire in -\\nfrastructure by combining Amazon’s various services has facilitated many successful \\nstartup companies, such as the social scrapbooking site Pinterest or the community \\ntravel marketplace Airbnb.

Moving to AWS allowed Airbnb to quickly obtain \\n200 servers without needing to negotiate service contracts or commit to minimum \\nusage. Flexibly scaling the infrastructure would have been close to impossible were \\nAirbnb using its own data center because of both the time and the money needed \\nto acquire this number of servers; and, at the time, who knew whether Airbnb’s busi-\\nness would actually take off? With a traditional in-house infrastructure, Airbnb would \\nhave had to add capacity in “chunks,” leading to either having too many unused \\nresources or not being able to satisfy its users’ demand; using a cloud infrastructure, \\nAirbnb can elastically scale the resources to be just above what is needed to keep the \\nusers satisfied (Figure 12-9).\\nCloud Characteristics The cloud computing model has several unique and essen-\\ntial characteristics that distinguish cloud computing from an in-house infrastruc-\\nture and provide various benefits to users (NIST, 2011). These characteristics are \\n discussed next.\\nOn-Demand Self-Service To allow for most flexibility, users can access cloud \\n resources in a buffet-style fashion on an as-needed basis without the need for lengthy \\nnegotiations with the service provider; in many cases, resources in the cloud are \\n accessible by the customer with no need for human interaction with the provider. In \\nthe case of AWS, a customer needs only a credit card (for billing purposes) and can \\nset up server instances or expand storage space via a Web-based control panel. For \\nbusinesses, whose needs may rapidly change, this allows for unprecedented flexibility, \\nas it greatly facilitates scaling the infrastructure up or down as needed.\\nRapid Elasticity Typically, servers and other elements of an IS infrastructure take \\nseveral weeks to be delivered and days or weeks to be configured (as a company’s IS \\npersonnel has to install and configure system software, databases, and application soft-\\nware, depending on the organization’s needs); in contrast, in a cloud  environment, \\ncomputing resources can be scaled up or down almost instantaneously and often \\nautomatically, based on user needs. Hence, there is no need to purchase  expensive \\nequipment to prepare for an anticipated surge in demand (which ultimately may \\nnot materialize) during the holiday season. If, however, the surge in  demand does \\nmaterialize, businesses can access the required resources instantaneously at almost \\nany quantity.\\nBroad Network Access As cloud services are accessed via the Internet, they are \\n accessible from almost anywhere and from almost any Web-enabled device. For \\n organizations, this enables real-time management of business processes, as applica-\\ntions hosted in the cloud can be accessed whenever needed, from any location, be \\nit from one’s desktop or laptop, or using an iPhone, iPad, or Android smartphone \\napp. Thus, knowledge workers can swiftly respond to anything that may require their \\n immediate attention, without having to be physically in their office.\\nDemand\\nDemand\\nCapacity\\nCapacity \\nIn-House Infrastructure Cloud Infrastructure\\nFigure 12-9\\nIt is difficult to match demand \\nusing an in-house infrastructure; \\nwith a cloud infrastructure, \\nresources can be added \\nincrementally, on an as-needed \\nbasis.\\n(Source: Valacich, Joseph, and \\nSchneider, Christoph, Information \\nSystems Today: Managing in the \\nDigital World, 7th ed., ©2016, pp. \\n112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 118.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\ASUS\\\\Desktop\\\\AI powered chatbot\\\\Data\\\\SAD.pdf', 'page': 452}, page_content='428 Part IV   Design\\nResource Pooling Rather than renting out space or time to each customer on one \\nspecific, physical machine, cloud providers manage multiple distributed resources \\nthat are dynamically assigned to multiple customers based on their needs. Hence, the \\ncustomer only rents a resource, with no knowledge or control over how it is provided \\nor where it is located. In some cases, however, service providers allow for specifying \\nparticular geographic areas of the resources; for example, a California company may \\nwant to rent resources located in California (close to its customers) so as to reduce \\nresponse latency, or a European company may need to rent storage space on servers \\nlocated in Europe so as to comply with data protection directives.\\nMeasured Service Service is typically provided using a utility computing model, \\nwhere customers pay only for what they use, and the metering depends on type of \\nresource. For example, customers are charged on an hourly basis for the use of server \\ninstances (the price typically depends on the instance’s computing power, memory, \\nand operating system), based on volume of data stored, and/or on data transferred \\ninto or out of the cloud. For customers, the fixed costs associated with the IS infrastruc-\\nture are thus transformed into variable costs, which are very easy to track and monitor.\\nService Models As can be seen from the previously mentioned examples, various \\nservices are provided in the cloud. Whereas some users require access only to certain \\nsoftware, others want to have more control, being able to run the software of their \\nchoice on a server in the cloud (Figure 12-10). Different cloud computing service \\nmodels (NIST, 2011) are discussed next.\\nInfrastructure as a Service In the infrastructure as a service (IaaS) model, only the \\nbasic capabilities of processing, storage, and networking are provided. Hence, the \\ncustomer has the most control over the resources. For example, using AWS, custom-\\ners can choose computing power, memory, operating system, and storage based on \\nindividual needs and requirements, thus being able to build (almost) their entire \\n infrastructure in the cloud. Using such infrastructure, Netflix migrated its own IT \\n infrastructure to AWS using EC2 and S3 to transcode movies into various formats, \\npower its customer-focused Web site, and host other mission-critical applications. The \\nIaaS model provides the customer with the greatest flexibility; on the other hand, \\nwhile the infrastructure is provided, managing software licenses is still the responsi-\\nbility of the customer, and setup costs are relatively high.\\nPlatform as a Service In the platform as a service (PaaS) model, customers can run \\ntheir own applications, which are typically designed using tools provided by the ser -\\nvice provider. In this model, the user has control over the applications but has limited \\nor no control over the underlying infrastructure. One example is Microsoft’s Win-\\ndows Azure, which acts as a cloud services operating system that customers can use \\ninfrastructure as a service \\n(iaaS)\\nA cloud computing model in which only the \\nbasic capabilities of processing, storage, \\nand networking are provided.\\nPlatform as a service (PaaS)\\nA cloud computing model in which \\nthe customer can run his or her own \\napplications that are typically designed \\nusing tools provided by the service \\nprovider; the customer has limited or no \\ncontrol over the underlying infrastructure.\\nPaaS\\nIaaS\\nOperating System\\nWeb Server\\nDatabase Management System\\nProgramming Language\\nApplication Software\\nSalesforce.com\\nSaaS\\nFigure 12-10 \\nServices by SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS \\nproviders.\\n(Source: Valacich, Joseph, and Schneider, \\nChristoph, Information Systems Today: \\nManaging in the Digital World, 7th ed., \\n©2016, pp. 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 118. \\nReprinted and electronically reproduced \\nby permission of P\\nearson Education, \\nInc., New York, NY.)'),\n",

Using this platform, Outback Steakhouse launched a \\nviral marketing campaign when it first introduced its Facebook Fan Page. To support \\nthe spikes in demand, Outback developed and deployed an e-mail marketing cam-\\npaign using Windows Azure. As the underlying computing platform is provided, the \\ncustomer does not have to worry about purchasing software licenses, for example, \\nfor the Web servers’ operating systems or for database management systems, and the \\nservice provider manages the functioning and updating of the platform provided.\\nSoftware as a Service In the software as a service (SaaS) model, the customer uses \\nonly applications provided via a cloud infrastructure. Typically, such applications \\n include Web-based e-mail services (e.g., Google’s Gmail) and Web-based produc-\\ntivity suites (such as Zoho or Google Docs), but also advanced applications such as \\n Customer Relationship Management system, as provided by salesforce.com. Typically, \\nthe customer cares only about the application, with no knowledge or control over the \\n underlying infrastructure, and typically has only limited ability to control or configure \\napplication-specific settings. Applications under the SaaS model are typically easiest \\nto deploy, because the customer does not have to worry about maintaining or updat-\\ning the software, the underlying platform, or the hardware infrastructure.\\nTypes of Clouds Cloud service providers such as Amazon.com offer what is referred \\nto as a public cloud. Services in a public cloud can be used by any interested party on \\na pay-per-use basis; hence, they are often used for applications that need rapid scal-\\nability (i.e., the ability to adapt to increases or decreases in demand for processing \\nor data storage), or in cases where there is insufficient capital or other resources to \\nbuild or expand an IT infrastructure. In contrast, a private cloud (or internal cloud) \\nis internal to an organization and can help the organization to balance demand and \\nsupply of computing resources within the organization; similar to a public cloud, a \\nprivate cloud provides self-service access to resources, allowing business users to pro-\\nvision resources on-demand using a utility computing model.

The first consideration is which \\napplications, services, or data to move to the cloud. Typically, there is no single cloud \\ncomputing provider that can meet all needs of most organizations. Rather, organi-\\nzations often have to partner with different service providers, selecting IaaS, PaaS, \\nand SaaS models based on the business’ needs, often combining public and private \\nclouds; as there is not one solution that fits all, organizations have to carefully weigh \\nthe benefits and downsides of cloud computing. In addition, organizations must care-\\nfully consider which cloud services provider to choose. Some of the long-term, strate-\\ngic issues that management should consider when evaluating different public cloud \\nservice providers include availability, reliability, scalability,  viability, security, privacy, \\ncompliance, diversity of offerings, openness, and cost (Figure 12-12). These are dis-\\ncussed next (see also Hofmann and Woods, 2010).\\nAvailability/Reliability The availability of the service is a primary concern for \\nmost organizations. As shown by examples from Google, Amazon, or Microsoft, not \\neven the largest public cloud computing providers are immune from failures, be \\nit  hardware failures, programming errors, or some network outage. Organizations \\nthus have to evaluate which applications to move to the cloud, and how to ensure \\nthe availability of cloud-based applications. In addition to examining what the prom-\\nised  uptime of the application/system is, what backups are made to the servers and \\nstorage, or whether sufficient bandwidth will be provided to access large amounts \\nof data,  organizations have to implement their own precautionary measures. As it is \\noften too costly (e.g., in terms of lost business or goodwill) to be affected by negative \\nevents, organizations should plan ahead and replicate their cloud-based infrastruc-\\nture in different locations. Related to this, an important criterion to consider is the \\nprovider’s support policies. In case something does not work as promised, how will \\nissues be resolved? One of the advantages of cloud computing is self-service, allowing \\nclients to provision resources as needed. At the same time, this can be a potential \\ndownside, as there is not always the guarantee of having help available, if needed. \\nThus, organizations must ensure that acceptable support capabilities and person-\\nnel are available, especially for mission-critical applications, to rapidly solve technical \\n issues when they arise.\\nScalability One of the biggest promises of cloud computing is scalability, such that \\norganizations can scale up or down their infrastructure as needed. Yet, not every pro-\\nvider will be able to meet every organization’s demands. Thus, organizations have to \\ncarefully evaluate to what extent the provider will be able to meet current and future \\nbusiness needs in terms of data storage, transaction volumes, and so on.\\nViability Another important issue is associated with the viability and stability of the \\nprovider in the long run. As an organization moves to a public cloud infrastructure, \\nit puts much data and processing capabilities into the hands of an outside entity. If \\nthis outside entity happens to go out of business, this can have many repercussions \\nfor the organization, such as costs and efforts involved in setting up a new infrastruc-\\nture, migrating applications, or transferring the data from the old provider to the \\nnew infrastructure.\\nViability\\nCosts\\nOpenness\\nPrivacy\\nSecurity AvailabilityReliability\\nCompliance Diversity of Offerings\\nScalability\\nFigure 12-12 \\nOrganizations have to consider various \\nissues when managing their cloud \\ninfrastructure.\\n(Source: Valacich, Joseph, and Schneider, \\nChristoph, Information Systems Today: \\nManaging in the Digital World, 7th ed., \\n©2016, pp. 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 118. \\nReprinted and electronically reproduced \\nby permission of P\\nearson Education, \\nInc., New York, NY.)'),\n",

Especially when sensitive data are con-\\ncerned, organizations have to question how secure the data will be from outside \\nintruders, how the privacy of customer data will be protected, and whether the \\ndata storage complies with regulations such as the Sarbanes–Oxley Act, the Health \\nInsurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), or standards such as the \\nPayment Card Industry Data Security Standard. In addition, many organizations are \\nfaced with  responding to data requests as part of civil or criminal litigation. Without \\nproper planning, responding to such data requests can end up costing many times \\nthe amount saved by utilizing cloud based services. By definition, a public cloud \\ninfrastructure is shared among different companies, with different applications run-\\nning on the same hardware; as a result, it is impossible for organizations to know \\nwhere exactly (physically) the data are located, and thus auditing who has access to \\nthe data is extremely difficult, if not impossible. Whereas in an in-house infrastruc-\\nture, a company has complete control over its own data, this control is lost in a cloud \\ninfrastructure, and organizations have less legal rights if their data are stored in the \\ncloud. Similarly, cloud computing providers may be asked to hand over sensitive \\ndata stored on their servers to law enforcement, leaving the organization with little \\ncontrol. Especially for industries heavily concerned with privacy and data protection, \\nsuch as firms in the medical or legal fields, these issues are of critical importance. \\nOn the other hand, public cloud computing providers are certainly aware of these \\nissues, and organizations have to weigh which applications or data to move to the \\ncloud, and which to keep in-house.\\nIssues such as availability, reliability, and security are normally covered in ser -\\nvice-level agreements, which are contracts specifying the level of service provided in \\nterms of performance (e.g., as measured by uptime), warranties, disaster recovery, \\nand so on. A big caveat is that such service-level agreements do not guarantee the \\navailability of resources; rather, they only promise certain service levels and provide \\nfor refunds or discounts if these promises are not met, and can thus be regarded \\nmostly as a vehicle for resolving conflicts in case of problems.\\nFor businesses, this poses a serious dilemma, as such refunds and discounts only \\ncover the costs paid for the service, but can never offset the opportunity costs arising \\nfrom lost business. On the other hand, when evaluating the benefits and drawbacks \\nof moving the infrastructure to the public cloud, organizations also have to criti-\\ncally evaluate how they would be able to maintain certain uptime using an in-house \\ninfrastructure, and at what costs; often, organizations realize that even though cer-\\ntain SLAs may not be met by the provider, the provider can still offer better uptime \\nthan a poorly managed in-house infrastructure. In evaluating their options, organi-\\nzations often choose a hybrid approach, having certain mission-critical applications \\nin-house, while moving other, less demanding applications (in terms of uptime, etc.) \\nto the public cloud.\\nDiversity of Offerings  As discussed earlier, there are various providers of cloud \\ncomputing services, ranging from IaaS to SaaS. As a larger number and diversity of \\nproviders is more difficult to manage, many organizations prefer to deal with fewer \\nproviders that can meet all needs. Thus, an important question to ask is which pro-\\nvider can offer the services needed both currently and in the future.\\nOpenness  A related question organizations face is the issue of interoperability. \\nMost cloud providers use different infrastructures, different ways to store data, \\nand so on. This, however, makes migrating data between providers extremely dif-\\nficult, and can lead a company to be locked in by a certain provider. In addi-\\ntion to different infrastructures and storage models, existing network bandwidth \\n(and data transmission costs) poses an additional limitation to interoperability, '),\n",

The utility computing model used by cloud computing providers gives orga-\\nnizations control over the resources used and paid for—the organization only pays \\nfor the resources used, and can scale the resources up or down when needed. Thus, \\nthis provides the organization with much transparency over the cost of the resources. \\nYet, there is considerable disagreement over whether moving to the public cloud is \\ncheaper than maintaining an in-house infrastructure. For example, the online game \\ndeveloper Zynga recently moved from a public cloud infrastructure to an in-house \\nprivate cloud, and decided to own, rather than rent, its infrastructure. Comparing \\nthe costs of owning versus renting is not an easy feat. Whereas it is easy to calculate \\nthe costs per month of a server in Amazon’s EC2 cloud, many organizations do not \\nknow how much exactly it costs to run a comparable server in an in-house infra-\\nstructure, including the costs of the server itself, the fees for software licenses, the \\nelectricity, the data center, the staff, and so on. Thus, organizations have to carefully \\nbalance the benefits and costs of the flexibility and scalability the cloud offers, such \\nas by using a cloud infrastructure only for periods of peak demand; needless to say, \\nthis adds another layer of complexity to the IT operations.\\nIn sum, there are various issues to consider when moving to a cloud infrastruc-\\nture, and each organization has to make various informed choices about how to har-\\nness the opportunities the cloud offers while minimizing potential drawbacks. In the \\nnext section, we will provide a brief discussion of various other applications enabled \\nby the cloud.\\nservice-Oriented architecture\\nIn order to achieve greater flexibility and agility, organizations have tried to move \\naway from deploying large, monolithic applications in favor of a service-oriented \\n architecture (SOA). Using SOA, business processes are broken down into individual \\ncomponents (or services) that are designed to achieve the desired results for the \\nservice consumer (which can either be an application, another service, or a person). \\nTo illustrate this concept, think about the next oil change for your car. As you can’t \\nbe an expert in everything, it is probably more effective to have someone change the \\noil for you. You may take your car to the dealership, you may go to an independent \\ngarage or oil change service, or you may ask your friend to do it for you. For you, all \\nthat matters is that the service will be provided at the expected level of quality and \\ncost, but you typically do not care if different service providers do things differently \\nor use different tools.\\nBy breaking down business processes into individual services, organizations can \\nmore swiftly react to changing business needs. For example, using an SOA approach, \\nmultiple services (such as “check inventory” or “order supplies”) would be orches-\\ntrated to handle the individual tasks associated with processing customer orders and \\ncould be changed relatively easily if the business process changes.\\nTo facilitate online collaboration with suppliers, business partners, and custom-\\ners, SOA uses and reuses individual services as “building blocks,” so that systems can \\nbe easily built and reconfigured as requirements change. To achieve these benefits, \\nservices have to follow three main principles:\\n1. Reusability. A service should be usable in many different applications.\\n2. Interoperability. A service should work with any other service.\\n3. Componentization. A service should be simple and modular.\\nService-oriented architecture \\n(SOA)\\nA software architecture in which business \\nprocesses are broken down into individual \\ncomponents (or services) that are designed \\nto achieve the desired results for the \\nservice consumer (which can be either an \\napplication, another service, or a person).'),\n",

Hosting and deploying such services in the cloud can help in build-\\ning applications using SOA. In addition, various services an organization may need \\nare available in the cloud, eliminating the need to “reinvent the wheel.” However, \\nwhereas an SOA  approach  appears to be appealing for many companies, it requires \\ntremendous effort and expertise to plan the architecture, select the right services \\nfrom hundreds or thousands of available services, and orchestrate and deploy the \\nservices. Hence, while an SOA  approach helps to increase flexibility, the integration \\nof various services can be extremely complex and can be well beyond the means of \\nsmall enterprises.\\nWeb services\\nThe most common approach for deploying a SOA is through the use of web services. \\nA web service is a method of communication between two electronic devices over \\na network (Web service, 2015). Most organizations today have a complex array of \\ntechnologies that need to interact with many different types of systems and devices. \\nMany of these systems need to exchange data, business logic, or processes with each \\nother. A web service is a method of communication that allows two software systems, \\nwhich may have been written in different languages, to exchange this data over the \\nInternet. The software system that makes a request is called a service requester, whereas \\nthe software system that would process the request and provide the response is called \\na service provider. Web services have specific rules governing the communication be-\\ntween systems, and utilize XML and JSON files for data exchange (both XML and \\nJSON are described next). Likewise, web services are not tied to any operating system \\nor programming language to work together; no custom coding is needed. Because \\nof this, web services have become a common way to integrate Web-based applica-\\ntions over the Internet. For instance, web services allow separate organizations to \\ncommunicate data without intimate knowledge of each other’s systems behind their \\nrespective firewalls.\\neXtensible Markup Language, or XML, is a language that defines a set of rules \\nfor encoding documents in a format which is both human- and machine-readable \\nWeb service\\nA method of communication between two \\nelectronic devices over a network.\\neXtensible Markup Language \\n(XML)\\nAn Internet authoring language that \\nallows designers to create customized \\ntags, enabling the definition, transmission, \\nvalidation, and interpretation of data \\nbetween applications.\\nServices Applications\\nProcess\\nCredit\\nCard\\nShip\\nProduct\\nDisplay\\nSales\\nDisplay\\nInventory\\nDisplay\\nProduct\\nE-commerce\\nWeb site\\nPoint-of-Sale\\nSystem\\nExecutive\\nDashboard\\nFigure 12-13 \\nUsing SOA, multiple applications can \\ninvoke multiple services.\\n(Source: Valacich, Joseph, and Schneider, \\nChristoph, Information Systems Today: \\nManaging in the Digital World, 7th ed., \\n©2016, pp. 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 118. \\nReprinted and electronically reproduced \\nby permission of P\\nearson Education, \\nInc., New York, NY.)'),\n",

XML is a lot like HTML, with tags, attributes, and \\nvalues, but it also allows designers to create customized tags, enabling the defini-\\ntion, transmission, validation, and interpretation of data between applications. \\nWhereas HTML has a fixed set of tags, designers can create custom languages—\\ncalled vocabularies—for any type of application in XML. This ability to create cus-\\ntomized languages is at the root of the power of XML; however, this power comes \\nat a price. Whereas HTML is very forgiving on the formatting of tags, XML is very \\nstrict. Additionally, as mentioned earlier, XML documents do not contain any \\nformatting information. XML tags simply define what the data mean. For this rea-\\nson, many believe that HTML will remain a popular tool for developing personal \\nWeb pages; XML has become the tool of choice for many commercial Internet \\napplications.\\nA second, and an increasingly popular approach for formatting data within \\na web service environment is JavaScript Object Notation, or JSON (pronounced \\nJ-SON). JSON is a lightweight data interchange approach that is relatively easy for \\nhumans to understand and for computers to generate or interpret. JSON is an \\n alternative to XML and is considered much more efficient to transfer and process, \\nand much easier for humans to understand. Because of these advantages, the use of \\nJSON has dramatically increased.\\nThere are two key technologies, SOAP and REST, which are used to assist in \\nthe communication within a web services environment. The first, SOAP, which re-\\nfers to Simple Object Access Protocol, facilitates the communication of XML be-\\ntween  applications and the operating system. SOAP builds on existing standards \\nto provide powerful communication capabilities, most notably, XML for format-\\nting messages and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) (see below for more infor-\\nmation on HTTP) and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) for transmitting \\nmessages. In addition to leveraging Internet standard communication protocols \\nlike HTTP and SMTP, SOAP also provides language and platform independence \\nas well as the ability to navigate through proxies and firewalls. A drawback to \\nSOAP, however, is that it is relatively verbose to compose and slower than alter-\\nnative approaches to transmit and process. The second approach for facilitating \\nthe communication within web services is called REST, or Representational State \\nTransfer. REST is a simpler and faster alternative to SOAP, typically communicat-\\ning over HTTP utilizing JSON for formatting information. Relative to SOAP and \\nXML, REST and JSON are much simpler to understand, easier for machines to \\nprocess and generate, and easier for humans to design and implement. As such, \\nREST and JSON are rapidly becoming a dominant standard within the develop-\\nment of web services.\\nDesigning internet systems\\nThe vast majority of new systems development in organizations focuses on Internet-\\nbased applications. The Internet can be used for delivering internal organizational \\nsystems, business-to-business systems, or business-to-consumer systems. The rapid \\nmigration to Internet-based systems should not be a surprise; it is motivated by the \\ndesire to take advantage of the global computing infrastructure of the Internet and \\nthe comprehensive set of tools and standards that has been developed. However, \\nas with any other type of system, there are numerous choices that have to be made \\nwhen designing an Internet application. The design choices you make can greatly \\ninfluence the ease of development and the future maintainability of any system.

BIND provides the ability to locate informa-\\ntion using common domain names that are translated into corresponding Internet \\nProtocol (IP) addresses. For example, the domain name www.arizona.edu translates \\nto 128.196.133.50.\\nUniversal user access on a broad variety of clients is achieved through a stan-\\ndardized communication protocol: the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). \\nHTTP is the agreed-upon format for exchanging information on the World Wide \\nWeb (see www.w3.org/Protocols/ for more information). The HTTP protocol defines \\nhow messages are formatted and transmitted as well as how Web servers and brows-\\ners respond to commands. For example, when you enter a URL into your browser, \\nan HTTP command is sent to the appropriate Web server requesting the desired \\nWeb page.\\nBeyond the naming standards of BIND and the transfer mechanism of HTTP, \\nan Internet-based system has another advantage over other types of systems: the \\nHypertext Markup Language (HTML). HTML is the standard language for rep-\\nresenting content on the Web through the use of hundreds of command tags. \\nExamples of command tags include those to bold text (<b>…</b>), to create tables \\n(<table>…</table>), or to insert links onto a Web page (<A href=http://www.arizona \\n.edu/> University of Arizona).\\nHaving standardized naming (BIND), translating (HTTP), and formatting \\n(HTML) enables designers to quickly craft systems because much of the complexity \\nof the design and implementation is removed. These standards also free the designer \\nfrom much of the worry of delivering applications over a broad range of computing \\ndevices and platforms. Together BIND, HTTP, and HTML provide a standard for \\ndesigners when developing Internet-based applications. In fact, without these stan-\\ndards, the Internet as we know it would not be possible.\\nOngoing Evolution  The infrastructure currently supporting HTML-based data \\nexchange is the same infrastructure that will support the widespread use of XML, \\nJSON, and other emerging standards. As we move beyond desktop computers and \\nstandard Web browsers, the greatest driver of change and evolution of Internet stan-\\ndards will be the need to support wireless mobile computing devices. As discussed \\npreviously, wireless mobile computing devices are often referred to as thin-client \\ntechnologies. Thin clients such as network PCs, tablets, and smartphones are being \\ndesigned to operate as clients in Internet-based environments (see Figure 12-14). \\nAlternatively, a workstation that can provide significant amounts of client-side stor-\\nage and processing is referred to as a fat client. Current PC workstations connected \\nto the Internet can be thought of as fat clients. For desktop PC workstations, Internet \\nbrowsers render content marked up in HTML documents. However, as thin clients \\ngain in popularity, designing applications to receive, send, and process XML or JSON \\nwill enable content to be displayed more effectively on any client device, regardless \\nof the screen size or resolution.\\nDomain naming system \\n(BiND)\\nA method for translating Internet domain \\nnames into Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. \\nBIND stands for Berkeley Internet Name \\nDomain.\\nHypertext Transfer Protocol \\n(HTTP)\\nA communication protocol for exchanging \\ninformation on the Internet.\\nHypertext Markup Language \\n(HTML)\\nThe standard language for representing \\ncontent on the Web through the use of \\nhundreds of command tags.'),\n",

A well-designed sys -\\ntem will isolate the content presentation from the business logic and data, allow -\\ning any Internet-capable device to become part of the overall distributed system. \\nTechniques to ensure the consistency of the site’s appearance for any type of device \\nare discussed next.\\nsite Consistency\\nA consistent “look and feel” is fundamental to conveying the image that a site \\nis professionally designed. A site with high consistency is also much easier for \\nusers to navigate, and it is much easier for users to anticipate the meaning of \\nlinks. From a practical standpoint, it is a poor design decision to not enforce \\na standard look and feel to an entire site. Development and maintenance can \\nbecome a nightmare when implementing changes to colors, fonts, or other ele -\\nments across thousands of Web pages within a site. In this section, we discuss ways \\nto help you enforce design consistency across an entire site and to simplify page \\nmaintenance.\\nCascading Style Sheets  One of the biggest difficulties in developing a large-scale \\nwebsite is maintaining consistency throughout the site with regard to color, back -\\nground, fonts, and other page elements. Experienced website designers have found \\nthat the use of Cascading Style Sheets (CSSs)  can greatly simplify site maintenance \\nand also ensure that pages are consistent (see www.w3.org/Style/CSS/). CSSs are \\nsimply a set of style rules that tell a Web browser how to present a document. The \\nbest way to implement CSSs is through the use of linked style sheets. Using this \\nmethod, through HTML’s LINK element, only a single file needs to be updated \\nwhen changing style elements across an entire site. The LINK element indicates \\nsome sort of a relationship between an HTML document and some other object or \\nfile (see Figure 12-15). CSSs are the most basic way to implement a standard style \\ndesign within a website.\\neXtensible Stylesheet Language  A second and more sophisticated method \\nfor implementing standard page styles throughout a site is via the eXtensible \\nStylesheet Language (XSL) . XSL is a specification for separating style from con -\\ntent when generating XML pages (see www.w3.org/TR/xsl/  for more information). \\nXSL allows  designers to apply single style templates to multiple pages in a man -\\nner similar to that of Cascading Style Sheets. XSL allows designers to dictate how \\nXML should be displayed whether the client device is a Web browser, handheld \\nCascading Style Sheets (CSSs)\\nA set of style rules that tells a Web browser \\nhow to present a document.\\neXtensible Stylesheet \\nLanguage (XSL)\\nA specification for separating style from \\ncontent when generating XML pages.\\nWireless Internet\\nFigure 12-14 \\nThin clients used to access the Internet'),\n",

In other words, XSL provides de -\\nsigners with specifications that allow XML content to be seamlessly displayed on \\nvarious client devices.\\nIn practical terms, XSL allows designers to separate presentation logic from \\nsite content. This separation standardizes a site’s “look and feel” without having \\nto customize to the capabilities of individual devices. Given the rapid evolution of \\n devices (e.g., desktop computers, mobile computing devices, and televisions), XSL \\nis a powerful method to ensure that information is displayed in a consistent man -\\nner and uses the capabilities of the client device. XSL-based formatting consists of \\ntwo parts:\\n1. Methods for transforming XML documents into a generic comprehensive form\\n2. Methods for formatting the generic comprehensive form into a device-specific \\nform\\nIn other words, XML content, queried from a remote data source, is format -\\nted based on rules within an associated XSL style sheet (see Figure 12-16).

Many design issues will \\nsignificantly influence the long-term successful operation of a system. Therefore, in \\nthis section we will discuss those issues that are particularly important when design-\\ning an Internet-based system.\\nCustomer Loyalty and Trustworthiness  In order for your website to become the \\npreferred method for your customers to interact with you, they must feel that the \\nsite—and their data—are secure. There are many ways that the design of the site can \\nconvey trustworthiness to your users. Customers build trust from positive experiences \\ngained while interacting with a site (McKnight et al., 2002). According to Web design \\nguru Jakob Nielsen (1999), designers can convey trustworthiness in a website in the \\nfollowing ways:\\n1. Design quality. A professional appearance and clear navigation convey respect \\nfor customers and an implied promise of good service.\\n2. Up-front disclosure. Immediately inform users of all aspects of the customer rela-\\ntionship (e.g., shipping charges, data privacy policy); this conveys an open and \\nhonest relationship.\\n3. Comprehensive, correct, and current content. Up-to-date content conveys a commit-\\nment to provide users with the most up-to-date information.\\n4. Connected to the rest of the Web. Linking to outside sites is a sign of confidence \\nand lends credibility; an isolated site feels like it may have something to hide.\\nIn addition to these methods, protecting your customers’ data will also be a \\nsignificant factor for conveying trustworthiness. For example, many users are reluc-\\ntant to disclose their e-mail address for fear of getting frequent unsolicited messages \\n(spam). As a result, many users have learned to provide a secondary e-mail address—\\nusing services such as Gmail or Yahoo! mail—when trust has not yet been established. \\nConsequently, if you need to gather a customer’s e-mail address or other information, \\nyou should disclose why this is being done and how this information will be used in \\nthe future (e.g., information will be used only for order confirmation). Failure to \\nconsider how you convey trust to your customers may result in a system design that is \\nnot a success.\\nAnother way to increase loyalty and to convey trustworthiness to customers is \\nto provide useful, personalized content (see Nielsen, 1998a; Nielsen and Loranger, \\n2006). Personalization refers to providing content to a user based upon knowledge \\nof that customer. For example, once you register and place orders on Amazon.com, \\neach time you visit you are presented with a customized page that is based upon your \\nprior purchase behavior.\\nPersonalization should not be confused with customization. Customization \\n refers to sites that allow a user to customize the content and look of a site based \\non his or her personal preferences. For example, the popular Internet portals—\\nwebsites that offer a broad array of resources and services, such as Yahoo!, MSN, \\nand many of the popular search engines—allow users to customize the site based \\non their preferences and interests. Many organizations, including universities, are \\nalso using the portal concept for delivering organization-specific information and \\napplications (Nielsen, 2003; Nielsen and Loranger, 2006).\\nBecause a personalized site knows you, each time you visit you are presented \\nwith new personalized content without having to enter any additional information. \\nPersonalization\\nProviding Internet content to a user based \\nupon knowledge of that customer.\\nCustomization\\nInternet sites that allow users to customize \\nthe content and look of the site based on \\ntheir personal preferences.'),\n",

This method for personal-\\nizing site content is a success because users do not have to do anything to set it up. \\nFor example, users typically view the personalized data from Amazon.com favorably. \\nTo personalize each customer’s content, Amazon compares a user’s prior purchases \\nwith the purchasing behavior of millions of other customers to reliably make pur-\\nchase recommendations that may never have occurred to a customer. Amazon does \\na nice job of not making personalization recommendations too obtrusive so that if \\nthe system makes a bad guess at what the user might be interested in, the user isn’t \\nannoyed by having the site trying to be smarter than it actually is. For example, \\nmany users visit Amazon.com to purchase books as gifts for friends; using these \\ndata to personalize the site may impede the user’s experience when shopping for \\npersonal items.\\nLinks Must Live Forever For commercial Internet sites, your links must live forever. \\nThere are four primary reasons why professional developers have come to this con-\\nclusion (Nielsen, 1998b):\\n1. Customer bookmarks. Because customers may bookmark any page on your site, \\nyou cannot ever remove a page without running the risk of losing customers who \\nwould not find a working link if they encountered a dead link.\\n2. Links from other sites. Like your customers who bookmark pages, other sites may \\nlink directly to pages within your site; removing a page may result in losing cus-\\ntomer referrals.\\n3. Search engine referrals. Because search engines are often slow to update their \\n databases, this is another source for old and dead pages.\\n4. Old content adds value. In addition to these practical issues, many users may \\nactually find value from old content. Old content can remain useful to users \\nbecause of historic interest, old product support, or background information \\nfor recent events. Additionally, the cost of keeping old content is relatively \\nsmall. However, it is important to maintain old content so that links do not die \\nand that obsolete or misleading information is corrected or removed. Finally, \\nmake sure that you explicitly date old content, provide disclaimers that point \\nout what no longer  applies or is accurate, and provide forward-pointing links to \\ncurrent pages.\\nYou should not conclude from this discussion that Web content cannot change \\nand evolve. However, you should now understand that the links themselves cannot \\ndie. In other words, when users bookmark a page and return to your site, this link \\nshould return something useful to the user; otherwise, you run the risk of losing the \\ncustomer. With a small amount of maintenance on your site’s old content, you will \\nprovide a valuable resource to your customers. It should be obvious that customers \\nwho visit your site infrequently should easily be able to find what they are looking for; \\notherwise, they will become frustrated, leave, and not come back.\\nSystem Security A paradox lies in the fact that, within a distributed system, secu-\\nrity and ease of use are often in conflict with each other. A secure system is often \\nmuch less “user-friendly,” whereas an easy-to-use system is often less secure. When \\ndesigning an Internet-based system, successful sites strike an appropriate balance be-\\ntween security and ease of use. For example, many sites that require a password for \\nsite entry provide the functionality of “remember my password.” This feature will \\nmake a user’s experience at a site much more convenient and smooth, but it also \\nresults in a less secure environment. By remembering the password, anyone utilizing \\nthe user’s computer potentially has access to the initial user’s account and personal \\ninformation.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\ASUS\\\\Desktop\\\\AI powered chatbot\\\\Data\\\\SAD.pdf', 'page': 464}, page_content='440 Part IV   Design\\nIn addition, if you must require customers to register to use your site and gain \\naccess via passwords, experienced designers have learned that it is best to delay cus -\\ntomer registration and not to require registration to gain access to the top levels of the \\nsite. If you ask for registration too early, before you have demonstrated value to a new \\ncustomer, you run the risk of turning away the customer (Nielsen, 1997; Nielsen and \\nLoranger, 2006). Once a customer chooses to register on your site, make sure that the \\nprocess is as simple as possible. Also, if possible, store user information in client- or \\nserver-side cookies rather than requiring users to reenter information each time they \\nvisit your site. Of course, if your site requires high security (e.g., a stock trading site), \\nyou may want to require users to enter an explicit password at each visit. Security is \\nclearly a double-edged sword. Too much and you might turn customers away; too little \\nand you run the risk of losing customers because they do not trust the security of the \\nsite. Careful system design is needed to achieve the right balance between security and \\nease of use.\\nWebsite Content Management  In the early days of the Internet, websites were \\noften maintained by a small group of overworked developers; sites were often filled \\nwith outdated information and inconsistent layouts. To gain consistency in web -\\nsite appearance, organizations have utilized templates and stylesheets as described \\npreviously. To make sure websites contain the most accurate and up-to-date infor -\\nmation, often from multiple sources, many organizations have turned to using a \\ncontent management system (CMS) . A CMS is a special type of software application \\nfor collecting, organizing, and publishing website content from multiple organiza -\\ntional data sources, such as data warehouses, personnel databases, inventories, and \\nso on. This content is stored in a single repository along with templates for format -\\nting any type of Web page within the organization’s website. Because content and \\nformatting is separated by the CMS, the same underlying content can be presented \\ndifferently to different audiences—customers, employees, or suppliers—as well as \\nfor different devices (see Figure 12-17). Popular CMSs include WordPress, Joomla, \\nand Drupal.\\nContent management system \\n(CMS)\\nA special type of software application \\nfor collecting, organizing, and publishing \\nwebsite content.\\nContent Sources\\nTemplates Data\\nInternet\\nContent\\nManagement\\nSystem\\nOrganizational \\nWeb Server\\nFigure 12-17\\nA content management system allows \\ncontent from multiple sources to be stored \\nseparately from its formatting to ease \\nWebsite management'),\n",

For example, a personnel manager could author a new job de-\\nscription and post it at the CMS server using a standard word-processing pro-\\ngram like Microsoft Word. Once stored at the CMS server, the job posting text \\ncan be merged with a standard template that automatically formats it into a stan-\\ndard Web page. Once formatted, the Webmaster can review and approve the job \\nposting before it is published onto the publicly (intranet, Internet, or extranet) \\nviewed website. In this way, organizations can facilitate timely updates to their \\nWeb sites from throughout the organization, without having to wait for Web de-\\nvelopers to author pages. This separation of content, appearance, and publishing \\ngreatly improves organizational workflow and site management. It is only through \\na CMS that organizations can deploy sophisticated websites, containing thousands \\nof pages with rapidly changing content (e.g., visit a popular website with con-\\nstantly changing content like cnn.com and imagine how to keep this site up to \\ndate without a CMS).\\neLeCtrOniC COmmerCe aPPLiCatiOn: \\nDesigning a DistributeD aDvertisement \\nserver FOr Pine vaLLey Furniture’s \\nWebstOre\\nIn this chapter, we have examined numerous issues to consider when designing \\nInternet-based systems. As we saw in the prior two chapters, prototyping can be useful \\nin conceptualizing the look and feel of a website. The look and feel of a site is a func-\\ntion of the data presentation layer within an Internet-based application. Prototyping \\nalso provides a view of the transactions and processes within the system. Transactions \\nand processes are managed by the middle layer, data analysis, of a three-tiered archi-\\ntecture. In this section, we will see how a distributed system, the advertisement rota-\\ntion system, is integrated into PVF’s WebStore.\\nIn the prior two chapters, you read how Jim Woo defined specifications for the \\nforms and reports as well as the interface and dialogues for PVF’s WebStore. In this \\ndesign work, he and his development team concluded that they wanted the human–\\ncomputer interface of their site to have four key features:\\n1. Menu-driven navigation with cookie crumbs\\n2. Lightweight graphics\\n3. Form and data integrity rules\\n4. Stylesheet-based HTML\\nTo demonstrate these features to the team, Jim built a prototype (see Figure 12-18).\\nadvertising on Pine valley Furniture’s Webstore\\nHaving reviewed Jim Woo’s throwaway prototype of the WebStore, Jackie Judson \\nwanted to assess the feasibility of adding advertisements to the site. She came up with \\nthe following list of potential benefits for including advertising:\\n•\\t Potential to increase revenue generated from the WebStore\\n•\\t Potential to create cross-promotions and alliances with other online commerce \\nsystems\\n•\\t Potential to provide customers with improved service when looking for additional \\nproducts that accessorize PVF’s product line'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\ASUS\\\\Desktop\\\\AI powered chatbot\\\\Data\\\\SAD.pdf', 'page': 466}, page_content='442 Part IV   Design\\nJim agreed with the principles of advertising on the site and researched adver -\\ntising examples on an array of different Internet sites. He compiled the following \\nlist of potential concerns that need to be addressed in the system design in order to \\nimplement a successful advertisement rotation system within the WebStore:\\n•\\t Advertisements must be served quickly so that site performance is not affected.\\n•\\t Advertisements must be uniform in size and resolution, so they do not disrupt the \\nsite layout.\\n•\\t Advertisement links must not redirect the user’s browser away from the WebStore.\\nDesigning the advertising Component\\nTo begin the process, Jim modified the style sheets of the initial prototype to include \\na space where the advertisement would appear. Because all advertisements would be \\napproved by the marketing department before being included in the rotation, Jim \\ncould rely on the fact that they would be uniform in size and resolution. If an adver-\\ntisement is clicked, a new, smaller window is opened and directed to the advertiser’s \\nsite. The link is not direct, though. It is first directed to the advertising server within \\nthe WebStore system, the same server the advertisement came from. This “click-thru” \\ntransaction is logged, and the user is sent to the appropriate destination.\\nJim identified two distinct sets of data that would be generated by the adver -\\ntisement rotation system: the number of advertisements served and the number of \\n“click-thru’s.” The data being generated must be stored quickly and function trans-\\nparently within the overall operation of the system. The transactional requirements \\nof the advertisement system are the following:\\n1. Determine which advertisements apply, based on where the user is in the \\nWebStore.\\n2. Personalize the advertisement if the identity of the user has been established and \\nhis or her preferences are known.\\n3. Check for any seasonal or promotional advertisements.\\n4. Log the transaction.\\nThese requirements are part of the business rules that govern the rotation sys-\\ntem. Jim and Jackie want these parameters to be flexible and scalable so that future \\nsystems can incorporate these rules. To demonstrate how an advertisement might be \\nFigure 12-18 \\nInitial prototype of the WebStore'),\n",

Jim immediately began to write down all of the demographic information stored \\nin the customer-tracking system and cross-referenced it to the information stored \\nwhen an advertisement was clicked. This led Jim and Jackie to identify numerous po-\\ntential analytical queries that tied information from the customer-tracking system with \\nthe transactional data in the advertisement rotation system. A few of the queries they \\ncame up with included the following:\\n•\\t “How many women, when shopping for desks, clicked on an advertisement for \\nlamps?”\\n•\\t “How many advertisements were served to shoppers looking at filing cabinets?”\\n•\\t “How many people clicked on the first advertisement they saw?”\\n•\\t “How many people clicked on an advertisement and then purchased something \\nfrom the WebStore?”\\nBeing able to analyze these and other results will provide critical feedback from \\ntargeted marketing campaigns, seasonal promotions, and product tie-ins. Using \\na distributed, transaction-based advertisement system in the WebStore will keep \\nmaintenance costs low and should increase the revenue generated from the site. \\nInformation derived from the analytical queries of advertisement transaction data \\nincreases the site’s value even further.\\nJackie and Jim reviewed the advertising model with the entire marketing staff. \\nMany of the client account reps expressed interest in seeking a partnership with fre-\\nquent customers to do advertising on the site. Junior sales staff members were eager \\nto sell advertising space with the knowledge that they could provide purchasers with \\nfeedback on “click-thru” rates and overall advertisement views. One of the graphic \\ndesigners even produced an advertisement on the spot for an upcoming product \\nrelease. Everyone seemed to agree that the advertisement rotation system would in-\\ncrease the value of the WebStore to PVF.\\nFigure 12-19\\nAdding advertising to the WebStore \\nprototype'),\n",

You learned about the client/server \\narchitecture, which is being used to network personal \\ncomputers and workstations and to replace older main-\\nframe applications. Components of the client/server \\narchitecture, including LANs, database servers, applica-\\ntion programming interfaces, and application develop-\\nment tools, were described.\\nTwo common types of LAN-based architectures—file \\nserver and client/server—were compared. It was shown \\nthat the newer client/server technologies have significant \\nadvantages over the older file servers. We also outlined the \\nevolution of distributed systems and three-tiered client/\\nserver technologies that are giving analysts more options \\nfor distributed system design.\\nCloud computing uses a utility computing business \\nmodel, where customers can draw on a variety of com-\\nputing resources that can be accessed on demand, with \\nminimal human interaction. Characteristics of cloud \\n computing include on-demand self-service, rapid elas-\\nticity, broad network access, resource pooling, and mea-\\nsured service. Typical cloud computing service models are \\ninfrastructure as a service, platform as a service, and soft-\\nware as a service. When considering the move to a public \\ncloud-based infrastructure, organizations have to weigh \\nissues such as availability, reliability, scalability,  viability, \\nsecurity, privacy, compliance, openness, diversity of offer-\\nings, and, not least, cost. Cloud computing supports ser -\\nvice oriented architectures and the use of Web services to \\nmore easily integrate systems and deploy them on a vari-\\nety of devices.\\nWhen designing Internet-based systems, standardized \\nlocation naming, content translating, and document for -\\nmatting enable designers to quickly craft systems  because \\nmuch of the complexity of the design and implementation \\nis removed. These standards also free the  designer from \\nmuch of the worry of delivering  applications over a broad \\nrange of computing devices and platforms. Many commer-\\ncial Internet applications are vast and can contain thousands \\nof distinct pages. A consistent “look and feel” is fundamen-\\ntal to conveying the image that the site is professionally de-\\nsigned. A site with high consistency is also much easier for \\nusers to navigate and is much more intuitive so users can an-\\nticipate the meaning of links. Two techniques for enforcing \\nconsistency when designing large-scale Web applications are \\nthe use of CSSs and the XSL. Given the desire to deliver the \\nInternet to a broader array of client devices, there is a trend \\nto separate Web content from its delivery. Electronic com-\\nmerce applications are particularly embracing this trend \\nand are adopting standards such as XML and JSON to au-\\nthor Web data and XSL to manage content formatting in \\naddition to using style sheets to enforce consistency in the \\ndesign of a website across client devices. Finally, a successful \\n design will make users feel that the site—and their data—\\nare secure. Customers build trust from positive experiences \\ninteracting with a site. Taking steps to convey trustworthi-\\nness will help to attract and retain customers.\\nWe did not have the space in this chapter to  address \\nseveral additional issues concerning distributed and \\nInternet systems. Many of these issues are handled by \\nother systems professionals, such as database administra-\\ntors, telecommunications experts, and computer security \\nspecialists. Systems analysts must work closely with other \\nprofessionals to build sound distributed systems.'),\n",

The purpose of im-\\nplementation is to build a properly working system,  install \\nit in the organization, replace old systems and work meth-\\nods, finalize system and user documentation, train users, \\nand prepare support systems to assist users. Implemen-\\ntation also involves closedown of the project, including \\nevaluating personnel, reassigning staff, assessing the suc-\\ncess of the project, and turning all resources over to those \\nwho will support and maintain the system. The purpose of \\nmaintenance is to fix and enhance the system to respond \\nto problems and changing business conditions. Mainte-\\nnance includes activities from all systems development \\nphases. Maintenance also involves  responding to requests \\nto change the system, transforming requests into changes, \\ndesigning the changes, and implementing them.\\nWe address the variety of work done during system \\nimplementation in Chapter 13. For projects based on \\nAgile Methodologies, coding and testing are done in con-\\ncert with analysis and design, so systems resulting from \\nsuch efforts will begin their implementation phases with \\ncoding and testing already completed. Projects based on \\ntraditional methodologies will begin implementation with \\ndetailed design specifications that are handed over to \\nprogramming teams for coding and to quality assurance \\nteams for testing. In Chapter 13, you will learn about test-\\ning systems and system components, and methods to en-\\nsure and measure software quality. Your role as a systems \\nanalyst may include developing a plan for testing, which \\nincludes developing all the test data required to exercise \\nevery part of the system. You start developing the test plan \\nearly in the project, usually during analysis, because test-\\ning requirements are highly related to system functional \\nrequirements. You also will learn how to document each \\ntest case and the results of each test. A testing plan usually \\nfollows a bottom-up  approach, beginning with small mod-\\nules, followed by extensive alpha testing by the program-\\nming group, beta testing with users, and final acceptance \\ntesting. Testing ensures the quality of the software by using \\nmeasures and methods such as structured walk-throughs.\\nInstalling a new system involves more than making \\ntechnical changes to computer systems. Managing installa-\\ntion includes managing organizational changes as much as \\nit does technical changes. We review several approaches to \\ninstallation and several frameworks you can use to anticipate \\nand control human and organizational resistance to change.\\nDocumentation is extensive for any system. You \\nhave been developing most of the system documentation \\nneeded by system maintenance staff by keeping a thor-\\nough project workbook or CASE repository. You now need \\nto finalize user documentation. In Chapter 13, we pro-\\nvide a generic outline for a user’s guide as well as a wide \\nrange of guidelines you can use to develop high-quality \\nuser documentation. Remember, documentation must be \\ntested for completeness, accuracy, and readability.\\nWhile documentation is being finalized, user sup-\\nport activities also need to be designed and implemented. \\nSupport includes training, whether through traditional, \\ninstructor-led classes; computer-based tutorials or e-learn-\\ning; or vendor-provided training. Electronic performance \\nsupport systems deliver on-demand training. Many types of \\ntraining are available from various sources over the Internet \\nor corporate intranets. Once trained, users will still encoun-\\nter difficulties. Therefore, you, as an analyst, must consider \\nongoing support from help desks, newsletters, user groups, \\nonline bulletin boards, and other mechanisms, and these \\nsources of support need to be tested and implemented. We \\nconclude Chapter 13 with a brief review of project close-\\ndown activities because the end of implementation means \\nthe end of the project. We also provide an example of im-\\nplementation for the Pine Valley Furniture WebStore.\\nAfter implementation, however, work on the system is \\njust beginning. Today, as much as 80 percent of the life cycle \\ncost of a system occurs after implementation. Maintenance \\nhandles updates to correct flaws and to accommodate new \\ntechnologies as well as to meet new business conditions, \\nregulations, and other requirements. In Chapter 14, you \\nwill learn about your role in systems maintenance.\\nThere are four kinds of maintenance: corrective, \\nadaptive, perfective, and preventive. You can help con-\\ntrol the potentially monumental cost of a system by mak-\\ning systems maintainable. You can affect maintainability \\nby reducing the number of defects, improving the skill \\nof users, preparing high-quality documentation, and de-\\nveloping a sound system structure.\\nYou may also be involved in establishing a mainte-\\nnance group for a system. You will learn about different or-\\nganizational structures for maintenance personnel and the \\nreasons for each, and you will learn how to measure mainte-\\nnance effectiveness. Configuration management and decid-\\ning how to handle change requests are important. You will \\nlearn how a systems librarian keeps track of baseline software \\nmodules, checks these out to maintenance staff, and then \\nrebuilds systems. You will also learn about special issues for \\nmaintaining websites and read about an example of a main-\\ntenance situation for the Pine Valley Furniture WebStore.\\nChapter 13 includes the final installment of the \\nPetrie Electronics project case. This final case segment \\nhelps you to understand implementation issues in an or-\\nganizational context.\\nPart Five\\nImplementation and Maintenance'),\n",

In a traditional \\nplan-driven systems development project, physical  design \\nspecifications must be turned into working computer \\ncode, and the code must be tested until most of the \\n errors have been detected and corrected. In a systems \\ndevelopment project governed by Agile Methodologies, \\ndesign, coding, and testing are done in concert, as you \\nlearned in previous chapters. Regardless of methodology \\nused, once coding and testing are complete and the sys-\\ntem is ready to “go live,” it must be installed (or put into \\nproduction), user sites must be prepared for the new sys-\\ntem, and users rely on the new system rather than the \\nexisting one to get their work done.\\nImplementing a new information system into an \\norganizational context is not a mechanical process. The \\norganizational context has been shaped and reshaped by \\nthe people who work in the organization. The work habits, \\nbeliefs, interrelationships, and personal goals of an orga-\\nnization’s members all affect the implementation process. \\nAlthough factors important to successful implementation \\nhave been identified, there are no sure recipes you can \\nfollow. During implementation, you must be attuned to \\nkey aspects of the organizational context, such as history, \\npolitics, and environmental demands—aspects that can \\ncontribute to implementation failure if ignored.\\nIn this chapter, you will learn about the many \\n activities that the implementation phase comprises. We \\nwill discuss coding, testing, installation, documentation, \\nuser training, support for a system after it is installed, \\nand implementation success. Our intent is not to teach \\nyou how to program and test systems—most of you have \\nalready learned about writing and testing programs in \\nthe courses you took before this one. Rather, this chap-\\nter shows you where coding and testing fit in the overall \\nscheme of implementation, especially in a traditional, \\nplan-driven context. The chapter stresses the view of \\n implementation as an organizational change process that \\nis not always successful.\\nIn addition, you will learn about providing docu -\\nmentation about the new system for the information sys-\\ntems personnel who will maintain the system and for the \\nsystem’s users. These same users must be trained to use \\nwhat you have developed and installed in their workplace. \\n13.5 Explain why system implementation sometimes \\nfails.\\n13.6 Describe the threats to system security and \\nremedies that can be applied.\\n13.7 Show how traditional implementation issues apply \\nto electronic commerce applications.\\nLearning Objectives\\nAfter studying this chapter, you should be able to:\\n13.1 Provide an overview of the system implementation \\nprocess.\\n13.2 Describe how software applications are tested.\\n13.3 Apply four installation strategies: direct, parallel, \\nsingle-location, and phased installation.\\n13.4 List the deliverables for documenting the system \\nand for training and supporting users.\\n System Implementation\\n13 \\nChapter \\nIntroduction'),\n",

You must \\nprovide a means for users to get answers to these questions and to identify needs for \\nfurther training.\\nAs a member of the system development team that developed and imple-\\nmented the new system, your job is winding down now that installation and conver -\\nsion are complete. The end of implementation marks the time for you to begin the \\nprocess of project closedown. At the end of this chapter, we will turn to the topic of \\nformally ending the systems development project.\\nAfter a brief overview of the coding, testing, and installation processes and \\nthe deliverables and outcomes from these processes, we will talk about software \\napplication testing. We then present the four types of installation: direct, parallel, \\nsingle-location, and phased. You then will read about the process of documenting \\nsystems and training and supporting users as well as the deliverables from these \\nprocesses. We then discuss the various types of documentation and numerous \\nmethods available for delivering training and support services.

You will also read about \\nthe threats to security that organizations face and some of the things that can be \\ndone to make systems more secure. Finally, you will see how the implementation \\nof an electronic commerce application is similar to the implementation of more \\ntraditional systems.\\nSySteM IMpleMentatIon\\nSystem implementation is made up of many activities. The six major activities we \\nare concerned with in this chapter are coding, testing, installation, documentation, \\ntraining, and support (see Figure 13-1).

Coding and testing may have already been com-\\npleted by this point if Agile Methodologies have been followed. Using a plan-driven \\nmethodology, coding and testing are often done by other project team members \\nbesides analysts, although analysts may do some programming. In any case, ana-\\nlysts are  responsible for ensuring that all of these various activities are properly \\nplanned and executed. Next, we will briefly discuss these activities in two groups: \\n(1)  coding, testing, and installation and (2) documenting the system and training \\nand supporting users.\\nCoding, testing, and Installation processes\\nCoding, as we mentioned before, is the process whereby the physical design specifi-\\ncations created by the analysis team are turned into working computer code by the \\nprogramming team. Depending on the size and complexity of the system, coding can \\nbe an involved, intensive activity. Regardless of the development methodology fol-\\nlowed, once coding has begun, the testing process can begin and proceed in parallel. \\nAs each program module is produced, it can be tested individually, then as part of a \\nlarger program, and then as part of a larger system. You will learn about the different \\nstrategies for testing later in this chapter. We should emphasize that, although testing \\nis done during implementation, you must begin planning for testing earlier in the \\nproject. Planning involves determining what needs to be tested and collecting test \\ndata. This is often done during the analysis phase because testing requirements are \\nrelated to system requirements.\\nInstallation is the process during which the current system is replaced by the \\nnew system. This includes conversion of existing data, software, documentation, and \\nwork procedures to those consistent with the new system. Users must give up the old \\nways of doing their jobs, whether manual or automated, and adjust to accomplishing \\nthe same tasks with the new system. Users will sometimes resist these changes, and you \\nmust help them adjust. However, you cannot control all the dynamics of user–system \\ninteraction involved in the installation process.\\nDeliverables and outcomes from Coding, testing,  \\nand Installation\\nTable 13-1 shows the deliverables from the coding, testing, and installation pro-\\ncesses. Some programming languages include utilities to generate documentation \\nautomatically, while others require more effort on the part of the coder to establish \\ngood documentation. But even well-documented code can be mysterious to mainte-\\nnance programmers who must maintain the system for years after the original system \\nwas written and the original programmers have moved on to other jobs. Therefore, \\nclear, complete documentation for all individual modules and programs is crucial to \\nthe system’s continued smooth operation.

For example, what type of test was conducted? What test \\ndata were used? How did the system handle the test? The answers to these questions \\ncan provide important information for system maintenance because changes will \\n require retesting, and similar testing procedures will be used during the mainte-\\nnance process.\\nThe next two deliverables, user guides and the user training plan, result \\nfrom the installation process. User guides provide information on how to use \\nthe new system, and the training plan is a strategy for training users so that they \\ncan quickly learn the new system. The development of the training plan probably \\nbegan earlier in the project, and some training, on the concepts behind the new \\nsystem, may have already taken place. During the early stages of implementation, \\nthe training plans are finalized and training on the use of the system begins. \\nSimilarly, the installation plan lays out a strategy for moving from the old system \\nto the new, from the beginning to the end of the process. Installation includes \\ninstalling the system (hardware and software) at central and user sites. The in-\\nstallation plan answers such questions as when the new system will be installed, \\nwhich installation strategies will be used, who will be involved, what resources are \\n required, which data will be converted and cleansed, and how long the instal-\\nlation process will take. It is not enough that the system is installed; users must \\nactually use it.\\nAs an analyst, your job is to ensure that all of these deliverables are produced \\nand are done well. You may produce some of the deliverables, such as test data, user \\nguides, and an installation plan; for other deliverables, such as code, you may only \\nsupervise or simply monitor their production or accomplishment. The extent of \\nyour implementation responsibilities will vary according to the size and standards of \\nthe organization you work for, but your ultimate role includes ensuring that all the \\nimplementation work leads to a system that meets the specifications developed in \\nearlier project phases.\\nThe Processes of Documenting the System, Training Users, and Supporting \\nUsers Although the process of documentation proceeds throughout the life cycle, \\nit receives formal attention during the implementation phase because the end of \\nimplementation largely marks the end of the analysis team’s involvement in systems \\ndevelopment. As the team is getting ready to move on to new projects, you and the \\nother analysts need to prepare documents that reveal all of the important informa-\\ntion you have accumulated about this system during its development and implemen-\\ntation. There are two audiences for this final documentation: (1) the information \\nsystems personnel who will maintain the system throughout its productive life, and \\n(2) the people who will use the system as part of their daily lives. The analysis team in \\na large organization can get help in preparing documentation from specialized staff \\nin the information systems department.\\nLarger organizations also tend to provide training and support to computer \\nusers throughout the organization. Some of the training and support is very spe-\\ncific to particular application systems, whereas the rest is general to particular \\noperating systems or off-the-shelf software packages. For example, it is common \\nto find courses on Microsoft Windows® in organization-wide training facilities. \\nAnalysts are mostly uninvolved with general training and support, but they do \\nwork with corporate trainers to provide training and support tailored to particu-\\nlar computer applications they have helped to develop. Centralized information \\nsystem training facilities tend to have specialized staff who can help with train-\\ning and support issues. In smaller  organizations that cannot afford to have well-\\nstaffed centralized training and support facilities, fellow users are the best source \\nof training and support that users have, whether the software is customized or off \\nthe shelf.'),\n",

At the very least, the development team must prepare user \\ndocumentation. For most modern information systems, documentation includes \\nany  online help designed as part of the system interface. The development team \\nshould think through the user training process: Who should be trained? How \\nmuch training is adequate for each training audience? What do different types of \\nusers need to learn during training? The training plan should be supplemented \\nby actual training modules, or at least outlines of such modules, that at a mini-\\nmum address the three questions stated previously. Finally, the development team \\nshould also deliver a user support plan that addresses issues such as how users \\nwill be able to find help once the information system has become integrated into \\nthe organization. The development team should consider a multitude of support \\nmechanisms and modes of delivery. Each deliverable is addressed in more detail \\nlater in this chapter.\\nSoftware applICatIon teStIng\\nAs we mentioned previously, in traditional plan-driven systems development \\n projects, analysts prepare system specifications that are passed on to program-\\nmers for coding. Although coding takes considerable effort and skill, the prac-\\ntices and processes of writing code do not belong in this text. However, because \\n software application testing is an activity that analysts plan (beginning in the \\nanalysis phase) and sometimes supervise, depending on organizational stan-\\ndards, you need to understand the essentials of the testing process. Although this \\n section of the text focuses on testing from the perspective of traditional develop-\\nment practices, many of the same types of tests can be used during the analyze– \\ndesign–code–test cycle common to the Agile Methodologies. Coding and testing \\nin  eXtreme Programming will be discussed briefly toward the end of this section \\non testing.\\nSoftware testing begins early in the SDLC, even though many of the actual test-\\ning activities are carried out during implementation. During analysis, you develop \\na master test plan. During design, you develop a unit test plan, an integration test \\nplan, and a system test plan. During implementation, these various plans are put into \\n effect and the actual testing is performed.\\nThe purpose of these written test plans is to improve communication among \\nall the people involved in testing the application software. The plan specifies what \\neach person’s role will be during testing. The test plans also serve as checklists you \\ncan use to determine whether the master test plan has been completed. The master \\ntest plan is not just a single document, but a collection of documents. Each of the \\ncomponent documents represents a complete test plan for one part of the system or \\nTable 13-2  Deliverables for Documenting the System, Training, and Supporting Users\\n1.

Presenting a complete master test plan is far beyond the \\nscope of this book. To give you an idea of what a master test plan involves, we present \\nan abbreviated table of contents of one in Table 13-3.\\nA master test plan is a project within the overall systems development project. \\nBecause at least some of the system testing will be done by people who have not \\nbeen involved in the system development so far, the Introduction provides general \\ninformation about the system and the need for testing. The Overall Plan and Testing \\nRequirements sections are like a Baseline Project Plan for testing, with a schedule \\nof events, resource requirements, and standards of practice outlined. Procedure \\nControl explains how the testing is conducted, including how changes to fix errors \\nwill be documented. The fifth and final section explains each specific test necessary \\nto validate that the system performs as expected.\\nSome organizations have specially trained personnel who supervise and sup-\\nport testing. Testing managers are responsible for developing test plans, establish-\\ning testing standards, integrating testing and development activities in the life cycle, \\nand ensuring that test plans are completed. Testing specialists help develop test \\nplans, create test cases and scenarios, execute the actual tests, and analyze and re-\\nport test results.\\nSeven Different types of tests\\nSoftware application testing is an umbrella term that covers several types of tests. \\nMosley (1993) organizes the types of tests according to whether they employ static \\nor  dynamic techniques and whether the test is automated or manual. Static testing \\nmeans that the code being tested is not executed. The results of running the code \\nare not an issue for that particular test. Dynamic testing, on the other hand, involves \\nexecution of the code. Automated testing means the computer conducts the test, \\nwhereas manual testing means that people complete the test. Using this framework, \\nwe can categorize the different types of tests, as shown in Table 13-4.\\nLet’s examine each type of test in turn. Inspections are formal group activities \\nwhere participants manually examine code for occurrences of well-known  errors. \\nSyntax, grammar, and some other routine errors can be checked by automated in-\\nspection software, so manual inspection checks are used for more subtle errors. \\ninspections\\nA testing technique in which participants \\nexamine program code for predictable \\nlanguage-specific errors.\\nTable 13-3  Table of Contents of a Master Test Plan\\n1.

Code  inspection participants compare the code they are examining with \\na checklist of well-known errors for that particular language. Exactly what the code \\ndoes is not investigated in an inspection. It has been estimated that code inspec-\\ntions detect from 60 to 90 percent of all software defects as well as provide program-\\nmers with feedback that enables them to avoid making the same types of errors in \\nfuture work (Fagan, 1986). The inspection process can also be used for tasks such \\nas design specifications.\\nUnlike inspections, what the code does is an important question in a walk-\\nthrough. The use of structured walk-throughs is a very effective method of detect-\\ning errors in code. As you saw in Chapter 5, structured walk-throughs can be used \\nto review many systems development deliverables, including logical and physical \\ndesign specifications as well as code. Whereas specification walk-throughs tend \\nto be formal reviews, code walk-throughs tend to be informal. Informality tends \\nto make programmers less apprehensive about walk-throughs and helps increase \\ntheir frequency. According to Yourdon (1989), code walk-throughs should be done \\nfrequently when the pieces of work reviewed are relatively small and before the \\nwork is formally tested. If walk-throughs are not held until the entire program is \\ntested, the programmer will have already spent too much time looking for errors \\nthat the programming team could have found much more quickly. The program-\\nmer’s time will have been wasted, and the other members of the team may become \\nfrustrated because they will not find as many errors as they would have if the walk-\\nthrough had been conducted earlier. Further, the longer a program goes without \\nbeing subjected to a walk-through, the more defensive the programmer becomes \\nwhen the code is reviewed. Although each organization that uses walk-throughs \\nconducts them differently, there is a basic structure that you can follow that works \\nwell (see Figure 13-2).\\nIt should be stressed that the purpose of a walk-through is to detect errors, \\nnot to correct them. It is the programmer’s job to correct the errors uncovered in a \\nTable 13-4  a Categorization of Test Types\\nManual Automated\\nStatic Inspections Syntax checking\\nDynamic Walk-throughs Unit test\\nDesk checking Integration test\\nSystem test\\n(Source: Adapted from Mosley, 1993.)\\nGUIDELINES FOR CONDUCTING A CODE WALK-THROUGH\\n1.

Sometimes it can be difficult for the reviewers to refrain from suggest-\\ning ways to fix the problems they find in the code, but increased experience with the \\nprocess can help change a reviewer’s behavior.\\nWhat the code does is important in desk checking, an informal process in which \\nthe programmer or someone else who understands the logic of the program works \\nthrough the code with a paper and pencil. The programmer executes each instruc-\\ntion, using test cases that may or may not be written down. In one sense, the reviewer \\nacts as the computer, mentally checking each step and its results for the entire set of \\ncomputer instructions.\\nAmong the list of automated testing techniques in Table 13-4, only one tech-\\nnique is static—syntax checking. Syntax checking is typically done by a compiler. \\nErrors in syntax are uncovered but the code is not executed. For the other three \\nautomated techniques, the code is executed.\\nUnit testing, sometimes called module testing, is an automated technique \\nwhereby each module is tested alone in an attempt to discover any errors that may \\nexist in the module’s code. But because modules coexist and work with other mod-\\nules in programs and the system, they must also be tested together in larger groups. \\nCombining modules and testing them is called integration testing. Integration test-\\ning is gradual. First you test the coordinating module and only one of its subordi-\\nnate modules. After the first test, you add one or two other subordinate modules \\nfrom the same level. Once the program has been tested with the coordinating mod-\\nule and all of its immediately subordinate modules, you add modules from the \\nnext level and then test the program. You continue this procedure until the entire \\nprogram has been tested as a unit. System testing is a similar process, but instead \\nof integrating modules into programs for testing, you integrate programs into sys-\\ntems. System testing follows the same incremental logic that integration testing \\ndoes. Under both integration and system testing, not only do individual modules \\nand programs get tested many times, so do the interfaces between modules and \\nprograms.\\nCurrent practice calls for a top-down approach to writing and testing mod -\\nules. Under a top-down approach, the coordinating module is written first. Then \\nthe modules at the next level in the structure chart are written, followed by the \\nmodules at the next level, and so on, until all of the modules in the system are \\ndone. Each module is tested as it is written. Because top-level modules contain \\nmany calls to subordinate modules, you may wonder how they can be tested if the \\nlower-level modules haven’t been written yet. The answer is stub testing. Stubs are \\ntwo or three lines of code written by a programmer to stand in for the missing \\nmodules. During testing, the coordinating module calls the stub instead of the \\nsubordinate module. The stub accepts control and then returns it to the coordi-\\nnating module.\\nSystem testing is more than simply expanded integration testing where \\nyou are testing the interfaces between programs in a system rather than testing \\nthe interfaces between modules in a program. System testing is also intended to \\n demonstrate whether a system meets its objectives. This is not the same as test-\\ning a system to determine whether it meets requirements—that is the focus of \\nacceptance testing, which will be discussed later. To verify that a system meets \\nits objectives, system testing involves using nonlive test data in a nonlive testing \\nenvironment. Nonlive means that the data and situation are artificial, developed \\nspecifically for testing purposes, although both the data and the environment \\nare similar to what users would encounter in everyday system use. The system test \\nis typically conducted by information systems personnel and led by the project \\nteam leader, although it can also be conducted by users under MIS guidance.

We haven’t said very much about the process of testing \\nitself. There are two important things to remember about testing information systems:\\n1. The purpose of testing is to confirm that the system satisfies requirements.\\n2. Testing must be planned.\\nThese two points have several implications for the testing process, regardless of \\nthe type of test being conducted. First, testing is not haphazard. You must pay atten-\\ntion to many different aspects of a system, such as response time, response to boundary \\ndata, response to no input, response to heavy volumes of input, and so on. You must \\ntest anything (within resource constraints) that could go wrong or be wrong with a sys-\\ntem. At a minimum, you should test the most frequently used parts of the system and \\nas many other paths throughout the system as time permits. Planning gives analysts \\nand programmers an opportunity to think through all the potential problem areas, list \\nthese areas, and develop ways to test for problems. As indicated previously, one part \\nof the master test plan is creating a set of test cases, each of which must be carefully \\ndocumented (see Figure 13-3 for an outline of a test case description).\\nA test case is a specific scenario of transactions, queries, or navigation paths \\nthat represent a typical, critical, or abnormal use of the system.

This \\nis important for all code, whether written in-house, developed by a contractor, or \\npurchased. Test cases need to determine that new software works with other exist-\\ning software with which it must share data. Even though analysts often do not do \\nthe testing, systems analysts, because of their intimate knowledge of applications, \\noften make up or find test data. The people who create the test cases should not \\nbe the same people as those who coded and tested the system. In addition to a \\ndescription of each test case, there must also be a description of the test results, \\nwith an emphasis on how the actual results differed from the expected results (see \\nFigure 13-4). This description will indicate why the results were different and what, \\nif anything, should be done to change the software. This description will then sug-\\ngest the need for retesting, possibly introducing new tests to discover the source of \\nthe differences.\\nOne important reason to keep such a thorough description of test cases \\nand results is so that testing can be repeated for each revision of an application. \\nAlthough new versions of a system may necessitate new test data to validate new \\nfeatures of the application, previous test data usually can and should be reused. \\nResults from the use of the test data with prior versions are compared to new ver-\\nsions to show that changes have not introduced new errors and that the behavior \\nof the system, including response time, is no worse. A second implication for the \\ntesting process is that test cases must include illegal and out-of-range data. The \\nsystem should be able to handle any possibility, no matter how unlikely; the only \\nway to find out is to test.\\nPine Valley Furniture Company\\nTest Case Results\\nTest Case Number:\\nDate:\\nProgram Name:\\nModule Under Test:\\nSuggestions for next steps:\\nFigure 13-4 \\nTest case results form\\n(Source: Adapted from Mosley, 1993.)'),\n",

Manual code reviews can be very \\ntime consuming and tedious work; and, most importantly, are not always the best solu-\\ntion. As such, special purpose testing software, called a testing harness, is being devel-\\noped for a variety of environments to help designers automatically review the quality \\nof their code. In many situations, a testing harness will greatly enhance the testing \\nprocess because it can automatically expand the scope of the tests beyond the cur-\\nrent development platform as well as be run every time there is a new version of the \\nsoftware. For instance, with the testing harness called Costello, a developer can answer \\nquestions such as how stable is the code? Does the code follow standard rules? Will \\nthe code work across multiple platforms? When deploying large-scale, multi-platform \\nprojects, automatic code review systems have become a necessity.\\nCombining Coding and testing\\nAlthough coding and testing are in many ways part of the same process, it is not un-\\ncommon in large and complicated systems development environments to find the \\ntwo practices separated from each other. Big companies and big projects often have \\ndedicated testing staffs that develop test plans and then use the plans to test software \\nafter it has been written. You have already seen how many different types of testing \\nthere are, and you can deduce from that how elaborate and extensive testing can be. \\nAs you recall, with eXtreme Programming (XP) (Beck and Andres, 2004) and other \\nAgile Methodologies, coding and testing are intimately related parts of the same pro-\\ncess, and the programmers who write the code also write the tests. The general idea \\nis that code is tested soon after it is written.\\nAfter testing, all of the code that works may be integrated at the end of each \\nworking day, and working versions of the system will be released frequently, as often \\nas once per week in some cases. XP developers design and build working systems in \\nvery little time (relative to traditionally organized methods).\\nOne particular technique used in XP to continually improve system quality is \\nrefactoring. Refactoring is nothing more than simplifying a system, typically after a new \\nfeature or set of features has been added. As more features are added to a system, \\nit becomes more complex, and this complexity will be reflected in the code. After a \\ntime of increasing complexity, XP developers stop and redesign the system. The system \\nmust still pass the test cases written for it after it has been simplified, so rework con-\\ntinues until the tests can be passed. Different forms of refactoring include simplifying \\ncomplex statements, abstracting solutions from reusable code, and removing duplicate \\ncode. Refactoring and the continuing simplification it implies reflect the iterative na-\\nture of XP and the other Agile Methodologies. As development progresses and the \\nsystem gets closer to being ready for production, the iterations and the evolution of the \\nsystem slow, a process Beck (2000) calls “productionizing.” A system ready to go into \\nproduction is ready to be released to users, either customers ready to buy the software \\nor internal users.\\nacceptance testing by Users\\nOnce the system tests have been satisfactorily completed, the system is ready for \\n acceptance testing, which is testing the system in the environment where it will \\neventually be used. Acceptance refers to the fact that users typically sign off on the \\nsystem and “accept” it once they are satisfied with it. The purpose of acceptance \\ntesting is for users to determine whether the system meets their requirements. The \\nextent of acceptance testing will vary with the organization and with the system \\nin question. The most complete acceptance testing will include alpha testing, in \\nwhich simulated but typical data are used for system testing; beta testing, in which \\nlive data are used in the users’ real working environment; and a system audit con -\\nducted by the organization’s internal auditors or by members of the quality assur -\\nance group.\\nTesting harness\\nAn automated testing environment used to \\nreview code for errors, standards violations, \\nand other design flaws.\\nrefactoring\\nMaking a program simpler after adding a \\nnew feature.\\nAcceptance testing\\nThe process whereby actual users test a \\ncompleted information system, the end \\nresult of which is the users’ acceptance \\nof\\xa0it.\\nAlpha testing\\nUser testing of a completed information \\nsystem using simulated data.\\nBeta testing\\nUser testing of a completed information \\nsystem using real data in the real user \\nenvironment.'),\n",

The types of tests performed during alpha testing include the \\nfollowing:\\n•\\t Recovery testing—forces the software (or environment) to fail in order to verify \\nthat recovery is properly performed.\\n•\\t Security testing—verifies that protection mechanisms built into the system will \\nprotect it from improper penetration.\\n•\\t Stress testing—tries to break the system (e.g., what happens when a record is writ-\\nten to the database with incomplete information or what happens under extreme \\nonline transaction loads or with a large number of concurrent users).\\n•\\t Performance testing—determines how the system performs in the range of pos-\\nsible environments in which it may be used (e.g., different hardware configu-\\nrations, networks, operating systems, and so on); often the goal is to have the \\nsystem perform with similar response time and other performance measures in \\neach environment.\\nIn beta testing, a subset of the intended users runs the system in the users’ \\nown environments using their own data. The intent of the beta test is to determine \\nwhether the software, documentation, technical support, and training activities work \\nas intended. In essence, beta testing can be viewed as a rehearsal of the installation \\nphase. Problems uncovered in alpha and beta testing in any of these areas must be \\ncorrected before users can accept the system. Systems analysts can tell many stories \\nabout long delays in final user acceptance due to system bugs.\\nInStallatIon\\nThe process of moving from the current information system to the new one is \\ncalled installation. All employees who use a system, whether they were consulted \\nduring the development process or not, must give up their reliance on the current \\nsystem and begin to rely on the new system. Four different approaches to instal-\\nlation have emerged over the years: direct, parallel, single-location, and phased \\n(Figure 13-5). The approach an organization decides to use will depend on the \\nscope and complexity of the change associated with the new system and the orga-\\nnization’s risk aversion.\\nDirect Installation\\nThe direct, or abrupt, approach to installation (also called “cold turkey”) is as \\nsudden as the name indicates: The old system is turned off and the new system is \\nturned on (Figure 13-5a). Under direct installation, users are at the mercy of the \\nnew system. Any errors resulting from the new system will have a direct impact \\non the users and how they do their jobs and, in some cases—depending on the \\ncentrality of the system to the organization—on how the organization performs \\nits business. If the new system fails, considerable delay may occur until the old \\nsystem can again be made operational and business transactions are reentered to \\nmake the database up to date. For these reasons, direct installation can be very \\nrisky. Further, direct installation requires a complete installation of the whole sys-\\ntem. For a large system, this may mean a long time until the new system can be \\ninstalled, thus delaying system benefits or even missing the opportunities that mo-\\ntivated the system request. On the other hand, it is the least expensive installation \\nmethod, and it creates considerable interest in making the installation a success. \\nSometimes, a direct installation is the only possible strategy if there is no way for \\nthe current and new systems to coexist, which they must do in some way in each of \\nthe other installation approaches.\\ninstallation\\nThe organizational process of changing \\nover from the current information system to \\na new one.\\nDirect installation\\nChanging over from the old information \\nsystem to a new one by turning off the old \\nsystem when the new one is turned on.'),\n",

Under parallel installa-\\ntion, the old system continues to run alongside the new system until users and man-\\nagement are satisfied that the new system is effectively performing its duties and the \\nold system can be turned off (Figure 13-5b).

Because all work is essentially done twice, a parallel installation can be \\nvery expensive; running two systems implies employing (and paying) two staffs to not \\nonly operate both systems, but also to maintain them. A parallel approach can also \\nbe confusing to users because they must deal with both systems. As with direct instal-\\nlation, there can be a considerable delay until the new system is completely ready for \\ninstallation. A parallel approach may not be feasible, especially if the users of the sys-\\ntem (such as customers) cannot tolerate redundant effort or if the size of the system \\n(number of users or extent of features) is large.\\nSingle-location Installation\\nSingle-location installation, also known as location or pilot installation, is a middle-\\nof-the-road approach compared with direct and parallel installation. Rather than \\nconvert all of the organization at once, single-location installation involves chang-\\ning from the current to the new system in only one place or in a series of separate \\nsites over time. (Figure 13-5c depicts this approach for a simple situation of two \\nlocations.) The single location may be a branch office, a single factory, or one de-\\npartment, and the actual approach used for installation in that location may be \\nany of the other  approaches. The key advantage to single-location installation is \\nthat it limits potential damage and potential cost by limiting the effects to a single \\nsite. Once management has determined that installation has been successful at one \\nlocation, the new system may be deployed in the rest of the organization, possibly \\ncontinuing with installation at one location at a time. Success at the pilot site can \\nbe used to convince reluctant personnel at other sites that the system can be worth-\\nwhile for them as well. Problems with the system (the actual software as well as \\ndocumentation, training, and support) can be resolved before deployment to other \\nsites. Even though the single-location  approach may be simpler for users, it still \\nplaces a large burden on  information systems (IS) staff to support two versions of \\nthe system. On the other hand, because problems are isolated at one site at a time, \\nIS staff members can devote all of their efforts to success at the pilot site. Also, if dif-\\nferent locations require sharing of data, extra programs will need to be written to \\nsynchronize the current and new systems; although this will happen transparently \\nto users, it is extra work for IS staff. As with each of the other approaches (except \\nphased installation), the whole system is installed; however, some parts of the orga-\\nnization will not get the benefits of the new system until the pilot installation has \\nbeen completely tested.\\nphased Installation\\nPhased installation, also called staged installation, is an incremental approach. \\nWith phased installation, the new system is brought online in functional compo-\\nnents; different parts of the old and new systems are used in cooperation until \\nthe whole new system is installed. (Figure 13-5d shows the phase-in of the first \\ntwo modules of a new system.) Phased installation, like single-location installa-\\ntion, is an attempt to limit the organization’s exposure to risk, whether in terms \\nof cost or disruption of the business. By converting gradually, the organization’s \\nrisk is spread out over time and place. Also, a phased installation allows for some \\nbenefits from the new system before the whole system is ready. For example, new \\ndata-capture methods can be used before all reporting modules are ready. For \\na phased installation, the new and replaced systems must be able to coexist and \\nprobably share data. Thus, bridge programs connecting old and new databases \\nand programs often must be built. Sometimes, the new and old systems are so \\nincompatible (built using totally different structures) that pieces of the old sys-\\ntem cannot be incrementally replaced, so this strategy is not feasible. A phased \\ninstallation is akin to bringing out a sequence of releases of the system. Thus, a \\nphased approach requires careful version control, repeated conversions at each \\nSingle-location installation\\nTrying out a new information system at one \\nsite and using the experience to decide \\nif and how the new system should be \\ndeployed throughout the organization.\\nPhased installation\\nChanging from the old information system \\nto the new one incrementally, starting with \\none or a few functional components and \\nthen gradually extending the installation to \\ncover the whole new system.'),\n",

On the other hand, each phase of change is smaller and more manageable \\nfor all involved.\\nplanning Installation\\nEach installation strategy involves converting not only software, but also data and \\n(potentially) hardware, documentation, work methods, job descriptions, offices and \\nother facilities, training materials, business forms, and other aspects of the system. \\nFor example, it is necessary to recall or replace all the current system documenta-\\ntion and business forms, which suggests that the IS department must keep track of \\nwho has these items so that they can be notified and receive replacement items. In \\npractice, you will rarely choose a single strategy to the exclusion of all others; most in-\\nstallations will rely on a combination of two or more approaches. For example, if you \\nchoose a single-location strategy, you have to decide how installation will proceed \\nthere and at subsequent sites. Will it be direct, parallel, or phased?\\nOf special interest in the installation process is the conversion of data. Because \\nexisting systems usually contain data required by the new system, current data must \\nbe made error free, unloaded from current files, combined with new data, and \\nloaded into new files. Data may need to be reformatted to be consistent with more \\nadvanced data types supported by newer technology used to build the new system. \\nNew data fields may have to be entered in large quantities so that every record copied \\nfrom the current system has all the new fields populated. Manual tasks, such as tak-\\ning a physical inventory, may need to be done in order to validate data before they \\nare transferred to the new files. The total data conversion process can be tedious. \\nFurthermore, this process may require that current systems be shut off while the \\ndata are extracted so that updates to old data, which would contaminate the extract \\nprocess, cannot occur.\\nAny decision that requires the current system to be shut down, in whole or in \\npart, before the replacement system is in place must be done with care. Typically, \\noff-hours are used for installations that require a lapse in system support. Whether a \\nlapse in service is required or not, the installation schedule should be announced to \\nusers well in advance to let them plan their work schedules around outages in service \\nand periods when their system support might be erratic. Successful installation steps \\nshould also be announced, and special procedures put in place so that users can eas-\\nily inform you of problems they encounter during installation periods. You should \\nalso plan for emergency staff to be available in case of system failure so that business \\noperations can be recovered and made operational as quickly as possible. Another \\nconsideration is the business cycle of the organization. Most organizations face heavy \\nworkloads at particular times of year and relatively light loads at other times. A well-\\nknown example is the retail industry, where the busiest time of year is the fall, right \\nbefore the year’s major gift-giving holidays. You wouldn’t want to schedule installa-\\ntion of a new point-of-sale system to begin December 1 for a department store. Make \\nsure you understand the cyclical nature of the business you are working with before \\nyou schedule installation.\\nPlanning for installation may begin as early as the analysis of the organization \\nsupported by the system. Some installation activities, such as buying new hardware, \\nremodeling facilities, validating data to be transferred to the new system, and col-\\nlecting new data to be loaded into the new system, must be done before the software \\ninstallation can occur. Often the project team leader is responsible for anticipating \\nall installation tasks and assigns responsibility for each to different analysts.\\nEach installation process involves getting workers to change the way they work. \\nAs such, installation should be looked at not as simply installing a new computer \\nsystem, but as an organizational change process. More than just a computer system is \\ninvolved—you are also changing how people do their jobs and how the organization \\noperates.'),\n",

The approach taken by the development team, whether \\nmore traditional and plan oriented or more Agile, will also determine the amount \\nand type of documentation that is generated. System development projects do have \\nmany similarities, however, which dictate that certain activities be undertaken and \\nwhich of those activities must be documented. Bell and Evans (1989) illustrate how a \\ngeneric SDLC maps onto a generic list of when specific systems development docu-\\nmentation elements are finalized (Table 13-5). As you compare the generic life cycle \\nin Table 13-5 with the life cycle presented in this book, you will see that there are \\ndifferences, but the general structure of both life cycles is the same because both \\ninclude the basic phases of analysis, design, implementation, and project planning. \\nSpecific documentation will vary depending on the life cycle you are following, and \\nthe format and content of the documentation may be mandated by the organiza-\\ntion for which you work. However, a basic outline of documentation can be adapted \\nfor specific needs, as shown in Table 13-5. Note that this table indicates when docu-\\nmentation is typically finalized; you should start developing documentation elements \\nearly, as the information needed is captured.\\nWe can simplify the situation even more by dividing documentation into two \\nbasic types, system documentation and user documentation. System documentation \\nrecords detailed information about a system’s design specifications, its internal work-\\nings, and its functionality. In Table 13-5, all of the documentation listed (except for \\nSystem Delivery) would qualify as system documentation. Whereas system documen-\\ntation is intended primarily for maintenance programmers (see Chapter 14), user \\ndocumentation is intended primarily for users. An organization may have definitive \\nstandards on system documentation. These standards may include the outline for the \\nproject dictionary and specific pieces of documentation within it. Standards for user \\ndocumentation are not as explicit.\\nUser Documentation\\nUser documentation consists of written or other visual information about an applica-\\ntion system, how it works, and how to use it. An excerpt of online user documenta-\\ntion for Microsoft Word appears in Figure 13-6.

Such presentation methods \\nhave become standard for help files in online PC documentation.\\nFigure 13-6 shows a help file, which is just one type of user documentation. Other \\ntypes of user documentation include reference guides, quick reference guides, release \\ndescriptions, system administrator’s guides, and acceptance sign-offs (Table 13-5). A \\nreference guide consists of an exhaustive list of a system’s functions and commands, \\nusually in alphabetic order. Reference guides are very good for  locating specific infor-\\nmation; they are not as good for learning the broader picture of how to perform all of \\nthe steps required for a given task. A quick-reference guide provides essential informa-\\ntion about operating a system in a short, concise format. When computer resources \\nare shared and many users perform similar tasks on the\\xa0same machines (as with airline \\nreservation or mail-order catalog clerks), quick-reference guides are often printed on \\nindex cards or as small books and mounted on or near the computer terminal. An out-\\nline for a generic user’s guide (from Bell and Evans, 1989) is shown in Table 13-6. The \\npurpose of such a guide is to provide information on how users can use a computer \\nsystem to perform specific tasks. The information in a user’s guide is typically ordered \\nby how often tasks are performed and by their complexity.\\nIn Table 13-6, sections with an “n” and a title in square brackets mean that there \\nare many such sections, each for a different topic. For example, for an accounting ap-\\nplication, sections 4 and beyond might address topics such as entering a transaction \\nin the ledger, closing the month, and printing reports. The items in parentheses are \\noptional, included as necessary. An index becomes more important for larger user’s \\nguides. Figure 13-7 shows a quick start guide for Microsoft Excel. This particular refer-\\nence guide is intended for people who have never used Excel before. The organization \\nof user’s guides differs from one software product to the next.

A system administrator’s guide is intended primarily for those who will install and \\nadminister a new system. It contains information about the network on which the system \\nwill run, software interfaces for peripherals such as printers, troubleshooting, and setting \\nup user accounts. Finally, an acceptance sign-off allows users to test for proper system \\ninstallation and then signify their acceptance of the new system with their signatures.\\ntraInIng anD SUpportIng USerS\\nTraining and support are critical for the success of an information system. As the \\nperson whom the user holds responsible for the new system, you and other analysts \\non the project team must ensure that high-quality training and support are available. \\nAlthough training and support can be talked about as if they are two separate things, \\nin organizational practice the distinction between the two is not all that clear because \\nthe two sometimes overlap. After all, both deal with learning about computing.\\ntraining Information Systems Users\\nComputer use requires skills, and training people to use computer applications can \\nbe expensive for organizations. Training of all types is a major activity in American \\ncorporations, but information systems training is often neglected. Many organiza-\\ntions tend to underinvest in computing skills training. It is true that some organi-\\nzations institutionalize high levels of information system training, but many others \\noffer no systematic training at all.\\nThe type of training needed will vary by system type and user expertise. The list \\nof potential topics from which you will determine if training will be useful includes \\nthe following:\\n•\\t Use of the system (e.g., how to enter a class registration request)\\n•\\t General computer concepts (e.g., computer files and how to copy them)\\n•\\t Information system concepts (e.g., batch processing)\\n•\\t Organizational concepts (e.g., FIFO inventory accounting)\\n•\\t System management (e.g., how to request changes to a system)\\n•\\t System installation (e.g., how to reconcile current and new systems during phased \\ninstallation)\\nSupport\\nProviding ongoing educational and \\nproblem-solving assistance to information \\nsystem users. For in-house developed \\nsystems, support materials and jobs will \\nhave to be prepared or designed as part \\nof the implementation process.\\nFigure 13-7 \\nA quick start guide for Excel.\\n(Source: Microsoft Corporation)'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\ASUS\\\\Desktop\\\\AI powered chatbot\\\\Data\\\\SAD.pdf', 'page': 495}, page_content=' ChaPter 13    SyStem ImplementatIon 471\\nAs you can see from this partial list, many potential topics go beyond simply \\nhow to use the new system. It may be necessary for you to develop training for users \\nin other areas so that users will be ready, conceptually and psychologically, to use the \\nnew system. Some training, such as concept training, should begin early in the proj-\\nect because this training can assist in the “unfreezing” (helping users let go of long-\\nestablished work procedures) element of the organizational change process.\\nEach element of training can be delivered in a variety of ways. Table 13-7 lists \\nthe most common training methods used by information system departments. The \\nmost common delivery method for corporate training remains traditional instruc-\\ntor-led classroom training (U.S. GAO, 2003). Many times, users turn to the resident \\n expert and to fellow users for training. Users are more likely to turn to local experts \\nfor help than to the organization’s technical support staff because the local expert \\nunderstands the users’ primary work and the computer systems they use. Given their \\ndependence on fellow users for training, it should not be surprising that end users \\ndescribe their most common mode of computer training as self-training.\\nOne conclusion from the experience with user training methods is that an \\n effective strategy for training on a new system is to first train a few key users and then \\norganize training programs and support mechanisms that involve these users to pro-\\nvide further training, both formal and on demand. Often, training is most effective \\nif you customize it to particular user groups, and the lead trainers from these groups \\nare in the best position to provide this training to their colleagues.\\nIncreasingly, corporations are turning to e-learning as a key delivery mode for \\ntraining. Although the term e-learning is not precisely defined, it generally means \\nthe same thing as distance learning; that is, a formalized learning system designed to \\nbe carried out remotely, using computer-based electronic communication. You may \\nhave taken a distance-learning course at your school, or you may have experience in \\non-campus classes with some of the dominant software packages used in e-learning, \\nsuch as WebCT, Blackboard, or Desire2Learn. E-learning courses can be delivered \\nover the Internet or over company intranets. Such courses can be purchased from \\nvendors or prepared by the corporation’s in-house training staff. E-learning is rela-\\ntively inexpensive compared to traditional classroom training, and it has the addi-\\ntional advantage of being available anytime from just about anywhere. Students can \\nalso learn at their own pace. E-learning systems can make available several different \\nelements that enhance the learning experience, including simulations, online ac-\\ncess to mentors and experts, e-books, net meetings, and video on demand. Another \\ntrend in corporate training is blended learning, the combining of e-learning with in-\\nstructor-led classroom training. A recent survey reported that over 80 percent of re-\\nspondents were using e-learning or blended learning to train their employees (Kim \\net al., 2008). Half of the respondents in the study believed that e-learning would \\nbecome the dominant training delivery method in their organizations.\\nAnother training method listed in Table 13-7 is software help components. \\nFigure 13-8 shows the beginning of a tutorial for new users of Microsoft’s Excel 2013. \\nThe tutorial is designed for users of past versions of Excel who are switching to Excel \\n2013. Users can go through the tutorial at their own pace, whenever they want, stop-\\nping and starting it as necessary.\\nAs both training and support for computing are increasingly able to be delivered \\nonline in modules, with some embedded in software packages and applications, the \\nalready blurred distinction between training and support blurs even more. Some of \\nthe issues most particular to computer user support are examined in the next section.\\nSupporting Information Systems Users\\nHistorically, computing support for users has been provided in one of a few forms: \\non paper, through online versions of paper-based support, by third-party vendors, or \\nby other people who work for the same organization. As we stated earlier, support, \\nwhatever its form, has often been inadequate for users’ needs. Yet users consider sup-\\nport to be extremely important.\\nTable 13-7   Types of Training \\nMethods\\nResident expert\\nTraditional instructor-led classroom \\ntraining\\nE-learning/distance learning\\nBlended learning (combination of \\ninstructor-led and e-learning)\\nSoftware help components\\nExternal sources, such as vendors'),\n",

As organizations moved to client/server \\narchitectures, their need for support increased even more, and organizations began \\nto rely more and more on vendor support (Crowley, 1993). This increased need for \\nsupport came in part from the lack of standards governing client/server products \\nand the resulting need to make equipment and software from different vendors com-\\npatible. Vendors are able to provide the necessary support, but as they have shifted \\ntheir offerings from primarily expensive mainframe packages to inexpensive off-the-\\nshelf software, they find they can no longer bear the cost of providing the support for \\nfree. Most vendors now charge for support, and many have instituted 900 numbers \\nor sell customers unlimited support for a given monthly or annual charge.\\nAutomating Support  In an attempt to cut the costs of providing support and to \\ncatch up with the demand for additional support services, vendors have automated \\nmany of their support offerings. Online support forums provide users access to infor-\\nmation on new releases, bugs, and tips for more effective usage. Forums are offered \\nover the Internet or over company intranets. Voice-response systems allow users to \\nnavigate option menus that lead to prerecorded messages about usage, problems, \\nand workarounds. Organizations have established similar support mechanisms for \\nsystems developed or purchased by the organization. Internal e-mail and office auto-\\nmation can be used to support such capabilities within an organization.\\nVendors may offer support that enables users to access a vendor’s knowledge \\nbases, including electronic support services, a single point of contact, and priority \\naccess to vendor support personnel (Schneider, 1993). Product knowledge bases in-\\nclude all of the technical and support information about vendor products and pro-\\nvide additional information for on-site personnel to use in solving problems. Vendors \\nroutinely supply complete user and technical documentation via the Internet, includ-\\ning periodic updates, so that a user organization can provide this library of documen-\\ntation, bug reports, workaround notices, and notes on undocumented features online \\nto all internal users. Electronic support services include all of the vendor support \\nFigure 13-8 \\nA video tutorial for learning Excel 2013.\\n(Source: Microsoft Corporation)'),\n",

The \\nsingle point of contact is a system engineer who is often based on-site and serves as \\na liaison between the corporation and the vendor. Finally, priority access means that \\ncorporate workers can always get help via telephone or e-mail from a person at the \\nvendor company, usually within a prespecified response time of four hours or less.\\nSuch vendor-enhanced support is especially appropriate in organizations where \\na wide variety of a particular vendor’s products is in use, or where most in-house \\n application development either uses the vendor’s products as components of the \\nlarger system or where the vendor’s products are themselves used as the basis for \\napplications. An example of the former would be the case where an organization \\nhas set up a client/server architecture based on a particular vendor’s SQL server \\nand APIs. Which applications are developed in-house to run under the client/server \\narchitecture depends heavily on the server and APIs, and direct vendor support deal-\\ning with problems in these components would be very helpful to the enterprise in-\\nformation systems staff. An example of the second would include order entry and \\ninventory control application systems developed using Microsoft’s Access or Excel. \\nIn this case, the system developers and users, who are sometimes the same people for \\nsuch package-based applications, can benefit considerably from directly questioning \\nvendor representatives about their products.\\nProviding Support through a Help Desk  Whether assisted by vendors or going it \\nalone, the center of support activities for a specific information system in many orga-\\nnizations is the help desk. A help desk is an information systems department function \\nand is staffed by IS personnel. The help desk is the first place users should call when \\nthey need assistance with an information system. The help desk staff members either \\ndeal with the users’ questions or refer the users to the most appropriate person.\\nHelp desk personnel need to be good at communicating with users, listening to \\ntheir problems, and intelligently communicating potential solutions. These person-\\nnel also need to understand the technology they are helping users with. It is crucial, \\nhowever, that help desk personnel know when new systems and releases are being \\nimplemented and when users are being trained for new systems. Help desk person-\\nnel should be well trained on new systems. One sure recipe for disaster is to train \\nusers on new systems but not train the help desk personnel these same users will turn \\nto for their support needs.\\nSupport Issues for the analyst to Consider\\nSupport is more than just answering user questions about how to use a system to \\nperform a particular task or about the system’s functionality. Support also consists of \\ntasks such as providing for recovery and backup, disaster recovery, and PC mainte-\\nnance; writing newsletters and offering other types of proactive information sharing; \\nand setting up user groups. It is the responsibility of analysts for a new system to be \\nsure that all forms of support are in place before the system is installed.\\nFor medium to large organizations with active information system functions, \\nmany of these issues are dealt with centrally. For example, users may be provided with \\nbackup software by the central information systems unit and a schedule for routine \\nbackup. Policies may also be in place for initiating recovery procedures in case of sys-\\ntem failure. Similarly, disaster recovery plans are almost always established by the cen-\\ntral IS unit. Information systems personnel in medium-to-large organizations are also \\nroutinely responsible for PC maintenance because the PCs belong to the enterprise. \\nIS unit specialists might also be in charge of composing and transmitting newsletters \\nor overseeing automated bulletin boards and organizing user groups.\\nWhen all of these (and more) services are provided by central IS, you must \\nfollow the proper procedures to include any new system and its users in the lists of \\nthose to whom support is provided. You must design training for the support staff on \\nthe new system and make sure that system documentation will be available to it.

You may have to \\nwrite backup and recovery procedures and schedules, and the users’ departments may \\nhave to purchase and be responsible for the maintenance of their hardware. In some \\ncases, software and hardware maintenance may have to be outsourced to vendors or \\nother capable professionals.

Sometimes employees will not use the new system that has \\nbeen developed for them or, if they do use it, their level of satisfaction with it is very \\nlow.

October is one of the key months of \\nthe year for candy makers because of the Halloween holiday. \\nIn 1999, Hershey was having problems trying to get its candy \\ndelivered to warehouses and from there to retailers in time for \\nHalloween. Hershey was having trouble getting orders into its \\nnew system and getting the order details to the warehouses for \\nfulfillment. Its new $112 million order-fulfillment system, contain-\\ning components from SAP, Seibel, and Manugistics, was not \\nworking correctly. The system was supposed to have been in-\\nstalled in April of that year, but conversion was delayed until July \\ndue to incomplete development and testing. The remaining prob-\\nlems with the system were not found until the next high-volume \\nordering event of the candy maker’s year occurred, Halloween.\\nAnother case of implementation failure involves SAP and the \\ncity of Richmond, California. Richmond began installing SAP \\nin 2000. By mid-2004, the city had spent $4.5 million, and \\nthe implementation was still not complete. Instead of present-\\ning the city with the functionality it wanted in SAP’s R/3, some \\nof the city’s department heads said that the system had actu-\\nally created more work for them. The finance director reported \\nthat using the system to prepare the budget had actually re-\\nquired hundreds of hours of extra work on the part of his staff. \\nThe planning director reported that the system fell far short \\nof his needs for billing and revenue-tracking. While the city \\nattorney contemplated a lawsuit against SAP and the Denver-\\nbased consulting company hired to help with implementation, \\nthe city’s information technology director maintained that the \\nsystem  implementation was not a failure at all. At the time, \\nshe said that the problems cited by staff were just the usual \\ncomplaints from people not yet used to new technology. By \\nthe end of 2008, the city had decided to switch from SAP R/3 \\nto a system called MUNIS, a system designed specifically for \\nmunicipalities. The date for going live with MUNIS was set for \\nJanuary 1, 2009.\\nAvis Europe provides another example. In 2004, Avis \\nEurope incurred a £45m charge as a result of shutting down \\nits credit hire business and due to problems with information \\ntechnology.

Conventional wisdom holds that if both of these conditions \\nare met, you should have a successful implementation. But despite the support and \\nactive participation of management and users, information systems implementation \\nsometimes fails (see the box “System Implementation Failures” for examples).\\nManagement support and user involvement are important to implementation \\nsuccess, but they may be overrated compared to other factors that are also important. \\nResearch has shown that the link between user involvement and implementation \\nsuccess is sometimes weak (Ives and Olson, 1984). User involvement can help reduce \\nthe risk of failure when the system is complex, but user participation in the devel-\\nopment process only makes failure more likely when there are financial and time \\nconstraints in the development process (Tait and Vessey, 1988). Information systems \\nimplementation failures are too common, and the implementation process is too \\ncomplicated, for the conventional wisdom to be completely correct.\\nOver the years, other studies have found evidence of additional factors that are \\nimportant to a successful implementation process. Three such factors are: commit-\\nment to the project, commitment to change, and the extent of project definition and \\nplanning (Ginzberg, 1981b). Commitment to the project involves managing the sys-\\ntems development project so that the problem being solved is well understood and \\nthe system being developed to deal with the problem actually solves it. Commitment \\nto change involves being willing to change behaviors, procedures, and other aspects \\nof the organization. The extent of project definition and planning is a measure of \\nhow well the project was planned. The more extensive the planning effort is, the \\nless likely implementation failure is. Still another important factor related to imple-\\nmentation success is user expectations (Ginzberg, 1981a). The more realistic a user’s \\nearly expectations about a new system and its capabilities are, the more likely it is that \\nthe user will be satisfied with the new system and actually use it.\\nAlthough there are many ways to determine if an implementation has been suc-\\ncessful, the two most common and trusted are the extent to which the system is used, \\nand the users’ satisfaction with the system (Lucas, 1997). Lucas, who has studied in-\\nformation systems implementation in depth, identified six factors that influence the \\nextent to which a system is used (1997):\\n1. User’s personal stake. How important the domain of the system is for the user; in \\nother words, how relevant the system is to the work the user performs. The user’s \\npersonal stake in the system is itself influenced by the level of support manage-\\nment provides for implementation and by the urgency to the user of the prob-\\nlem addressed by the system. The higher the level of management support and \\nthe more urgent the problem, the higher the user’s personal stake in the system.\\n2. System characteristics. Includes aspects of the system’s design such as ease of use, \\nreliability, and relevance to the task the system supports.\\n3. User demographics. Characteristics of the user, such as age and degree of com-\\nputer experience.\\n4. Organizational support. These are the same issues of support you read about ear-\\nlier in this chapter. The better the system support, the more likely an individual \\nwill be to use the system.\\n5. Performance. What individuals can do with a system to support their work will have \\nan impact on extent of system use. The more users can do with a system and the \\nmore creative ways they can develop to benefit from the system, the more they will \\nuse it. The relationship between performance and use goes both ways. The higher \\nthe levels of performance, the more use. The more use, the greater the performance.\\n6. Satisfaction. Use and satisfaction also represent a two-way relationship. The \\nmore satisfied the users are with the system, the more they will use it. The more \\nthey use it, the more satisfied they will be.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\ASUS\\\\Desktop\\\\AI powered chatbot\\\\Data\\\\SAD.pdf', 'page': 500}, page_content='476 Part v   ImplementatIon and\\xa0maIntenance\\nThe factors identified by Lucas and the relationships they have to each other \\nare shown in the model in Figure 13-9. In the model, it is easier to see the rela-\\ntionships among the various factors, such as how management support and problem \\nurgency affect the user’s personal stake in the system. Notice also that the arrows \\nthat show the relationships between use and performance and satisfaction have two \\nheads, illustrating the two-way relationships between these factors.\\nIt should be clear that, as an analyst and as someone responsible for the success-\\nful implementation of an information system, you have more control over some fac-\\ntors than others. For example, you will have considerable influence over the system’s \\ncharacteristics, and you may have some influence over the levels of support that will \\nbe provided for users of the system. You have no direct control over a user’s demo-\\ngraphics, personal stake in the system, management support, or the urgency of the \\nproblem to the user. This doesn’t mean you can ignore factors that you can’t change. \\nOn the contrary, you need to understand these factors very well because you will have \\nto balance them with the factors you can change in your system design and in your \\nimplementation strategy. You may not be able to change a user’s demographics or \\npersonal stake in a system, but you can help design the system and your implementa-\\ntion strategy with these factors in mind.\\nThe factors mentioned so far are straightforward. For example, a lack of com-\\nputer experience can make a user hesitant, inefficient, and ineffective with a system, \\nleading to a system that is not providing its full potential benefit. If top management \\ndoes not seem to care about the system, why should subordinates care? However, ad-\\nditional factors can be categorized as political and might be more hidden, difficult to \\naffect, and even unrelated to the system that is being implemented, yet instrumental \\nto the system’s success.\\nThe basis for political factors is that individuals who work in an organization \\nhave their own self-interested goals, which they pursue in addition to the goals of their \\ndepartments and of their organizations. For example, people might act to  increase \\ntheir own power relative to that of their co-workers; at other times, people will act to \\nprevent co-workers with more power (such as bosses) from using that power or from \\ngaining more. Because information is power, information systems often are seen as \\ninstruments of one’s ability to influence and exert power. It is helpful to understand \\nthe history and politics around an information system, and to deal with negative \\n political factors as well as the more objective and operational ones. Sometimes politi-\\ncal interpretations provide better explanations for the implementation process and \\nwhy events took the course they did.\\nOnce an information system has been successfully implemented, the impor -\\ntance of documentation grows. A successfully implemented system becomes part of \\nthe daily work lives of an organization’s employees. Many of those employees will use \\nthe system, but others will maintain it and keep it running.\\nManagement\\nSupport\\nSystem\\nCharacteristics Performance\\nProblem\\nUrgency\\nUser’s\\nPersonal\\nStake\\nUse Satisfaction\\nUser\\nDemographics\\nOrganizational\\nSupport\\nFigure 13-9 \\nImplementation success\\n(Source: From Henry C.

According to CERT/CC (Computer \\nEmergency Readiness Team/Coordination Center) at Carnegie Mellon University, \\nthe number of unique system vulnerabilities cataloged in 2007 was 7236. That \\n number is seven times greater than the 1090 vulnerabilities reported in 2000. A \\nvulnerability is a weakness in a system that can be readily exploited by someone \\nwho knows about it and knows how to take advantage of it. CERT/CC stopped re-\\nporting the number of actual security-related incidents in 2003, when the number \\nhit 137,539, because such incidents had become so commonplace. Hard numbers \\nabout losses due to security breaches are difficult to obtain because most com-\\npanies that have suffered breaches are too embarrassed to admit it, and they are \\ncertainly too embarrassed to communicate the actual dollar value of any losses. \\nOne estimate for how much security breaches cost companies comes from a \\n survey on security conducted by PriceWaterhouseCoopers. For 2014, the reported \\n estimated annual average financial loss due to cybersecurity incidents was $2.7 \\nmillion USD. However, we can be sure the actual amount of loss across the entire \\nglobal economy is much, much more. Most firms do not like to admit financial \\nlosses due to security breaches, and those that do are hesitant to report the actual \\ntrue amounts.\\nIf organizations are victims of security breaches, what are the sources of these \\nthreats? Table 13-8 provides some of the answers. As you might expect, a major -\\nity of firms report that they have been victims of external threats, including mal-\\nware  (malicious software). Other external security threats include phishing attacks, \\nexploitation of applications, denial of service, and theft of computing or storage \\ndevices. Denial of service is a popular tactic used to prevent access to a website, \\norchestrated through sending the website server more messages than it can handle \\nin a short period of time. Note that although external threats are common, inter-\\nnal threats are common as well. The top three internal threats come from current \\nemployees, former employees, or contractors. Employee abuse includes such seem-\\ningly innocent activities as sending personal e-mail on company systems or surfing \\nthe Internet for personal use during work hours. Although these activities may not \\ndamage company systems, they do use company resources that may be needed for \\nwork. Downloading large music or video files during work hours on company equip-\\nment could actually impede work because downloading large files can consume \\nbandwidth and slow work processes. Unauthorized access to information or privi-\\nlege escalation by insiders is more devious, as these activities are committed with the \\nintent to harm the firm.\\nCompanies can act, and most do, to deal with information security issues. On \\naverage, most companies spend more on systems security than the average loss due to \\ncybersecurity for their company type. When companies and individuals start to think \\nabout systems security, they first think about technological solutions to the problem \\n(Schneier, 2000). As Table 13-8 shows, common solutions include firewalls, email \\nsecurity and spam filtering software, antivirus software, virtual private networks, and \\ndata encryption.\\nFirewalls, used by 93 percent of firms, are built to keep intruders out. A fire-\\nwall is a set of related programs that protects the resources of a network from users \\nfrom other networks. Basically, a firewall works closely with a router program to \\nexamine each network packet to determine whether to forward it toward its destina-\\ntion. A firewall is often installed in a specially designated computer separate from \\nthe rest of the network so that no incoming request can get directly at private net-\\nwork resources.\\nYet the weakest link in any computer defense is the people who use the com-\\nputer system. For example, many system users fail to use good passwords: they may \\ntell other people (including strangers) their passwords, or write their passwords on '),\n",

The best defensive technology \\nin the world cannot overcome human laziness and negligence. Experts argue that \\nthe human aspect of computer security can be dealt with through the implementa-\\ntion of procedures and policies regarding user behaviors (Denning, 1999; Mitnick \\nand Simon, 2002). Such policies involve system users not giving out passwords, \\nchanging passwords regularly, keeping operating system and virus detection soft-\\nware updated, and so on. Sound systems security practice demands the effective \\nuse of appropriate information technologies as well as the diligent involvement of \\nemployees and decision makers in the defense of organization information tech-\\nnology assets.\\neleCtronIC CoMMerCe applICatIon: SySteM \\nIMpleMentatIon anD operatIon for pIne \\nValley fUrnItUre’S webStore\\nLike many other analysis and design activities, system implementation and operation \\nof an Internet-based electronic commerce application is no different than the pro-\\ncesses followed for other types of applications.

Here we will examine how \\nthe WebStore system was tested before it was installed and brought online.\\nThe programming of all WebStore software modules has been completed. The \\nprogrammers have extensively tested each unique module, and it is now time to per-\\nform a systemwide test of the WebStore. In this section, we will examine how test \\ncases were developed, how bugs were recorded and fixed, and how alpha and beta \\ntesting were conducted.\\nDeveloping test Cases for the webStore\\nTo begin the systemwide testing process, Jim and the PVF development team de-\\nveloped test cases to examine every aspect of the system. Jim knew that system test-\\ning, like all other aspects of the SDLC, needed to be a very structured and planned \\nTable 13-8  Selected Statistics on IT Security (Data compiled from various sources.)\\nTop Three Identified External Sources of Security Incidents, 2014\\nHackers 24%\\nCompetitors 24%\\nActivists/Activist Organization/Hacktivists 16%\\nInformation Brokers 16%\\nTop Five Security Products in Use, 2014\\nFirewalls 93%\\nEmail Security and Spam Filtering 90%\\nEndpoint Protection (e.g., antivirus) 89%\\nVirtual Private Network (VPN) 83%\\nData Encryption 73%\\nTop Five Security Breaches, 2014\\nMalware (e.g., viruses)76%\\nPhishing 59%\\nWeb or Software Applications Exploited 35%\\nDenial of Service 26%\\nTheft of Computers or Storage Devices 25%\\nInformation Security Budget by Company Size, 2014\\nSmall (revenues less than  \\n$100 million)\\n$0.73 million\\nMedium (revenues $100 million –  \\n$1\\xa0billion)\\n$3.0 million\\nLarge (Revenues greater than $1\\xa0billion) $10.8 million\\nAverage Financial Losses due to Security  \\nIncidents, 2014\\nSmall (revenues less than $100 million) $0.41 million\\nMedium (revenues $100 million –  \\n$1\\xa0billion)\\n$1.3 million\\nLarge (Revenues greater than $1\\xa0billion) $5.9 million\\nTop Three Insider Sources of Security  \\nIncidents, 2014\\nCurrent Employees 35%\\nFormer Employees 30%\\nCurrent Service Providers/Consultants/ \\nContractors\\n18%'),\n",

Before opening the WebStore to the general public, every module and com-\\nponent of the system needed to be tested within a controlled environment. Based \\non his experience in implementing other systems, Jim felt that they would need to \\ndevelop approximately 150 to 200 separate test cases to fully examine the WebStore. \\nTo help focus the development of test cases and to assign primary responsibility to \\nmembers of his team to specific areas of the system, Jim developed the following list \\nof testing categories:\\n•\\t Simple functionality: Add to cart, list section, calculate tax, change personal \\ndata\\n•\\t Multiple functionality: Add item to cart and change quantity, create user account, \\nchange address\\n•\\t Function chains: Add item to cart, check out, create user account, purchase\\n•\\t Elective functions: Returned items, lost shipments, item out of stock\\n•\\t Emergency/crisis: Missing orders, hardware failure, security attacks\\nThe development group broke into five separate teams, each working to  develop \\nan extensive set of cases for each of the testing categories. Each team had one day to \\ndevelop their test cases. Once developed, each team would lead a walk-through so \\nthat everyone would know the totality of the testing process and to facilitate exten-\\nsive feedback to each team so that the testing process would be as comprehensive as \\npossible. To make this point, Jim stated, “What happens when a customer repeatedly \\nenters the same product into the shopping cart? Can we handle that? What happens \\nwhen the customer repeatedly enters and then removes a single product? Can we \\nhandle that? Although some of these things are unlikely to ever occur, we need to \\nbe confident that the system is robust to any type of customer interaction. We must \\ndevelop every test case necessary to give us confidence that the system will operate as \\nintended, 24-7-365!”\\nA big part of successful system testing is to make sure that no information is lost \\nand that all tests are described in a consistent way. To achieve this, Jim provided all \\nteams with standard forms for documenting each case and for recording the results \\nof each test. This form had the following sections:\\n•\\t Test Case ID\\n•\\t Category/Objective of Test\\n•\\t Description\\n•\\t System Version\\n•\\t Completion Date\\n•\\t Participant(s)\\n•\\t Machine Characteristics (processor, operating system, memory, browser, etc.)\\n•\\t Test Result\\n•\\t Comments\\nThe teams also developed standard codes for each general type of test, and \\nthese were used to create the Test Case ID. For example, all tests related to “Simple \\nFunctionality” were given an ID with SF as a prefix and a number as the suffix (e.g., \\nSF001). The teams also developed standards for categorizing tests, listing objectives, \\nand writing other test form contents. Establishing these standards ensured that the \\ntesting process would be consistently documented.\\nBug Tracking and System Evolution An outcome of the testing process is the iden-\\ntification of system bugs. Consequently, in addition to setting a standard method for \\nwriting and documenting test cases, Jim and the teams established several other rules \\nto ensure a smooth testing process. Experienced developers have long known that an \\naccurate bug-tracking process is essential for rapid troubleshooting and repair dur-\\ning the testing process. You can think of bug tracking as creating a “paper trail” that '),\n",

To make sure that \\nall bugs were documented in a similar way, the team developed a bug-tracking form \\nthat had the following categories:\\n•\\t Bug Number (simple incremental number)\\n•\\t Test Case ID That Generated the Bug\\n•\\t Is the Bug Replicable?\\n•\\t Effects\\n•\\t Description\\n•\\t Resolution\\n•\\t Resolution Date\\n•\\t Comments\\nThe PVF development team agreed that bug fixes would be made in batches \\nbecause all test cases would have to be redone every time the software was changed. \\nThe redoing of all the test cases each time the software is changed is done to ensure \\nthat in the process of fixing the bug, no other bugs are introduced into the system. \\nAs the system moves along in the testing process—as batches of bugs are fixed—the \\nversion number of the software is incremented. During the development and test-\\ning phases, the version is typically below the “1.0” first release version.\\nalpha and beta testing the webStore\\nAfter completing all system test cases and resolving all known bugs, Jim moved the \\nWebStore into the alpha-testing phase, in which the entire PVF development team \\nas well as personnel around the company would put the WebStore through its paces. \\nTo motivate employees throughout the company to actively participate in testing the \\nWebStore, several creative promotions and giveaways were held. All employees were \\ngiven a T-shirt that said, “I shop at the WebStore, do you?” Additionally, all employees \\nwere given $100 to shop at the WebStore and were offered a free lunch for their en-\\ntire department if they found a system bug while shopping on the system. Also during \\nalpha testing, the development team conducted extensive recovery, security, stress, \\nand performance testing. Table 13-9 provides a sample of the types of tests performed.\\nAfter completing alpha testing, PVF recruited several of their established cus-\\ntomers to help in beta testing the WebStore. As real-world customers used the system, \\nJim was able to monitor the system and fine-tune the servers for optimal system per-\\nformance. As the system moved through the testing process, fewer and fewer bugs \\nwere found. After several days of “clean” usage, Jim felt confident that it was time to \\nopen the WebStore for business.\\nwebStore Installation\\nThroughout the testing process, Jim kept PVF management aware of each success and \\nfailure.

In \\nfact, he was confident that the WebStore was ready to go online and would recom-\\nmend to PVF’s top management that it was time to “flip the switch” and let the world \\nenter the WebStore.\\nprojeCt CloSeDown\\nIn Chapter 3, you learned about the various phases of project management, from \\nproject initiation to closing down the project. If you are the project manager and \\nyou have successfully guided your project through all of the phases of the SDLC pre-\\nsented so far in this book, you are now ready to close down your project. Although the \\nmaintenance phase is just about to begin, the development project itself is over. As \\nyou will see in the next chapter, maintenance can be thought of as a series of smaller \\ndevelopment projects, each with its own series of project management phases.\\nAs you recall from Chapter 3, your first task in closing down the project involves \\nmany different activities, from dealing with project personnel to planning a celebra-\\ntion of the project’s ending. You will likely have to evaluate your team members, \\nreassign most to other projects, and perhaps terminate others. As project manager, \\nyou will also have to notify all of the affected parties that the development project is \\nending and that you are now switching to maintenance mode.\\nYour second task is to conduct post-project reviews with both your management \\nand your customers. In some organizations, these post-project reviews will follow for-\\nmal procedures and may involve internal or EDP (electronic data processing) audi-\\ntors. The point of a project review is to critique the project, its methods, its deliver-\\nables, and its management. You can learn many lessons to improve future projects \\nfrom a thorough post-project review.\\nThe third major task in project closedown is closing out the customer contract. \\nAny contract that has been in effect between you and your customers during the proj-\\nect (or as the basis for the project) must be completed, typically through the consent \\nof all contractually involved parties. This may involve a formal “signing off” by the cli-\\nents stating that your work is complete and acceptable. The maintenance phase will \\ntypically be covered under new contractual agreements. If your customer is outside \\nyour organization, you will also likely negotiate a separate support agreement.\\nAs an analyst member of the development team, your job on this particular \\nproject ends during project closedown. You will likely be reassigned to another proj-\\nect dealing with an organizational problem. Maintenance on your new system will \\nbegin and continue without you. To complete our consideration of the SDLC, how-\\never, we will cover the maintenance phase and its component tasks in Chapter 14.\\nSummary\\nThis chapter presented an overview of the various aspects \\nof the systems implementation process. You studied seven \\ndifferent types of testing: (1) code inspections, in which \\nthe code is examined for well-known errors; (2) walk-\\nthroughs, when a group manually examines what the code \\nis supposed to do; (3) desk checking, when an individual \\nmentally executes the computer instructions; (4) syntax \\nchecking, typically done by a compiler; (5) unit or module \\ntesting; (6) integration testing, in which modules are com-\\nbined and tested together until the entire program has \\nbeen tested as a whole; and (7) system testing, in which \\nprograms are combined to be tested as a system and where \\nthe system’s meeting of its objectives is examined. You also \\nlearned about acceptance testing, in which users test the \\nsystem for its ability to meet their requirements, using live \\ndata in a live environment.\\nYou read about four types of installation: (1) di-\\nrect, when the old system is shut off just as the new one \\nis turned on; (2) parallel, when both old and new systems \\nare run together until it is clear the new system is ready to \\nbe used exclusively; (3) single-location, when one site is \\nselected to test the new system; and (4) phased, when the \\nsystem is installed bit by bit.\\nYou learned about two types of documentation: \\n(1)\\xa0 system documentation, which describes in detail the \\ndesign of a system and its specifications; and (2) user doc-\\numentation, which describes a system and how to use it for \\nthe system’s users.'),\n",

Although there is some evidence that \\nlectures have their place in teaching people about com-\\nputing and information systems, the current emphasis in \\ntraining is on automated delivery methods, such as online \\nreference facilities, and multimedia training. The latter \\nembed training in the applications themselves in an at-\\ntempt to make training a seamless part of using an applica-\\ntion for daily operations. The emphasis in support is also \\non providing online delivery, including online support \\nforums. As organizations move toward client/server archi-\\ntectures, they rely more on vendors for support. Vendors \\nprovide many online support services, and they work with \\ncustomers to bring many aspects of online support in-\\nhouse. A help desk provides aid to users in a particular \\ndepartment or for a particular system.\\nYou saw how information systems researchers have \\nbeen trying to explain what constitutes a successful imple-\\nmentation. If there is a single main point in this chap-\\nter, it is that implementation is a complicated process, \\nfrom managing programmer teams, to the politics that \\n influence what happens to a system after it has been suc-\\ncessfully implemented, to planning and implementing \\nuseful training and support mechanisms. Analysts have \\nmany factors to identify and manage for a successful system \\nimplementation. Successful implementation rarely hap-\\npens by accident or occurs in a totally predictable manner. \\nThe first step in a successful implementation effort may be \\n realizing just that fact. Once systems are implemented, or-\\nganizations have to deal with threats from both inside and \\noutside the organization to the systems’ security.

He dreaded the phone call he knew he was \\ngoing to have to make.\\nThe original go-live date for a pilot implementation of \\nPetrie Electronics’ new customer relationship manage-\\nment (CRM) system was July 31. That was only six weeks \\naway, and Jim knew there was no way they were going to \\nbe ready. The XRA CRM they were licensing turned out to \\nbe a lot more complex than they had thought. They were \\nbehind schedule in implementing it. Sanjay Agarwal, who \\nwas a member of Jim’s team and who was in charge of \\nsystems integration for Petrie, wanted Jim to hire some \\nconsultants with XRA experience to help with implemen-\\ntation. So far, Jim had been able to stay under budget, but \\nmissing his deadlines and hiring some consultants would \\npush him over his budget limit.\\nIt didn’t help that John Smith, head of marketing, kept \\nsubmitting requests for changes to the original specifica-\\ntions for the customer loyalty program. As specified in the \\nproject charter, the new system was supposed to track \\ncustomer purchases, assign points for cumulative pur-\\nchases, and allow points to be redeemed for “rewards” at \\nlocal stores. The team had determined that those rewards \\nwould take the form of dollars-off coupons. Customers \\nwho enrolled in the program would be given accounts \\nwhich they could access from Petrie’s website. When \\nthey signed on, they could check their account activity to \\nsee how many points they had accumulated. If they had \\nearned enough points, they were rewarded with a cou-\\npon. If they wanted to use the coupon, they would have to \\nprint it out on their home printers and bring it in to a store \\nto use on a purchase. The team had decided long ago that \\nkeeping everything electronic saved Petrie the consider-\\nable costs of printing and mailing coupons to customers.\\nBut now marketing had put in a change request that \\nwould give customers a choice of having coupons \\nmailed to them automatically or printing them from the \\nwebsite at home. This option, although nice for custom-\\ners, added complexity to the XRA system implementa-\\ntion, and it added to the costs of operation. Jim had also \\nlearned yesterday from the marketing representative \\non his team, Sally Fukuyama, that now Smith wanted \\nanother change. Now he wanted customers to be able \\nto use the coupons for online purchases from Petrie’s \\nwebsite. This change added a whole new layer of com-\\nplexity, affecting Petrie’s existing systems for ordering \\nonline, in addition to altering yet again the implementa-\\ntion of the XRA CRM.\\nAs if that wasn’t enough, Juanita Lopez was now tell-\\ning Jim that she would not be ready to let the team pilot \\nPeTrIe elecTronIcS'),\n",

This is followed by a detailed discussion \\ncontrasting the types of maintenance and an overview of \\ncritical management issues. Finally, we describe the pro-\\ncess of maintaining Web-based applications, including an \\nexample for the Pine Valley Furniture’s (PVF’s) WebStore \\napplication.\\nMaintaining inforMation \\nSySteMS\\nOnce an information system is installed, the system is essen-\\ntially in the maintenance phase of the systems development \\nlife cycle (SDLC). When a system is in the maintenance \\nphase, some person within the systems development group \\nis responsible for collecting maintenance requests from sys-\\ntem users and other interested parties, such as system audi-\\ntors, data center and network management staff, and data \\nanalysts. Once collected, each request is analyzed to better \\nunderstand how it will alter the system and what business \\nbenefits and necessities will result from such a change. If \\nthe change request is approved, a system change is designed \\nand then implemented. As with the initial development of \\nthe system, implemented changes are formally reviewed \\nand tested before installation into operational systems.\\nIn this chapter, we discuss systems maintenance, the \\nlargest systems development expenditure for many or -\\nganizations. In fact, more programmers today work on \\nmaintenance activities than work on new development. \\nYour first job after graduation may very well be as a main-\\ntenance programmer/analyst. This disproportionate \\ndistribution of maintenance programmers is interesting \\nbecause software does not wear out in a physical manner \\nas do buildings and machines.\\nThere is no single reason why software is main-\\ntained; however, most reasons relate to a desire to \\nevolve system functionality in order to overcome in-\\nternal processing errors or to better support changing \\nbusiness needs. Thus, maintenance is a fact of life for \\nmost systems. This means that maintenance can begin \\nsoon after the system is installed. As with the initial de-\\nsign of a system, maintenance activities are not limited \\nonly to software changes, but include changes to hard-\\nware and business procedures. A question many people \\nhave about maintenance relates to how long organiza-\\ntions should maintain a system. Five years? Ten years? \\nLonger? There is no simple answer to this question, but \\nit is most often an issue of economics. In other words, at \\nwhat point does it make financial sense to discontinue \\nevolving an older system and build or purchase a new \\none? The focus of a great deal of upper IS management \\nattention is devoted to assessing the trade-offs between \\nmaintenance and new development. In this chapter, \\nwe will provide you with a better understanding of the \\n14.3 Describe maintenance management issues, \\nincluding alternative organizational structures, \\nquality measurement, processes for handling \\nchange requests, and configuration \\nmanagement.\\nLearning Objectives\\nAfter studying this chapter, you should be able to:\\n14.1 Explain and contrast four types of maintenance.\\n14.2 Describe several factors that influence the cost of \\nmaintaining an information system and apply these \\nfactors to the design of maintainable systems.\\nMaintaining information \\nSystems14 \\nChapter\\nIntroduction'),\n",

It \\nis here that the SDLC becomes a cycle, with the last activity leading back to the first. \\nThis means that the process of maintaining an information system is the process of \\nreturning to the beginning of the SDLC and repeating development steps until the \\nchange is implemented.\\nAlso shown in Figure 14-1, four major activities occur within maintenance:\\n1. Obtaining maintenance requests\\n2. Transforming requests into changes\\n3. Designing changes\\n4. Implementing changes\\nObtaining maintenance requests requires that a formal process be established \\nwhereby users can submit system change requests. Earlier in this book, we presented \\na user request document called a System Service Request (SSR), which is shown in \\nFigure 14-2. Most companies have some sort of document like an SSR to request new \\ndevelopment, to report problems, or to request new features within an existing system. \\nWhen developing the procedures for obtaining maintenance requests, organizations \\nmust also specify an individual within the organization to collect these requests and \\nmanage their dispersal to maintenance personnel. The process of collecting and dis-\\npersing maintenance requests is described in much greater detail later in this chapter.\\nOnce a request is received, analysis must be conducted to gain an understand-\\ning of the scope of the request. It must be determined how the request will affect \\nthe current system and how long such a project will take. As with the initial devel-\\nopment of a system, the size of a maintenance request can be analyzed for risk and \\nfeasibility(see Chapter 5). Next, a change request can be transformed into a for-\\nmal design change, which can then be fed into the maintenance implementation \\nphase. Thus, many similarities exist between the SDLC and the activities within the \\nmaintenance process. Figure 14-3 equates SDLC phases to the maintenance activi-\\nties described previously. The first phase of the SDLC—planning—is analogous to \\nthe maintenance process of obtaining a maintenance request (step 1). The SDLC \\nanalysis phase is analogous to the maintenance process of transforming requests into \\na specific system change (step 2). The SDLC design phase, of course, equates to the \\ndesigning changes process (step 3). Finally, the SDLC phase implementation equates \\nto step 4, implementing changes. This similarity between the maintenance process \\nand the SDLC is no accident. The concepts and techniques used to initially develop \\na system are also used to maintain it.\\nDesignImplementation\\nPlanning\\nMaintenance Analysis\\nObtaining Maintenance Requests\\nTransforming Requests into Changes\\nDesigning Changes\\nImplementing Changes\\nFigure 14-1 \\nSystems development life cycle'),\n",

This means that all \\ndocuments created or modified during the maintenance effort, including the system \\nitself, represent the deliverables and outcomes of the process. Those programs and \\ndocuments that did not change may also be part of the new system. Because most or-\\nganizations archive prior versions of systems, all prior programs and documents must \\nbe kept to ensure the proper versioning of the system. This enables prior versions of \\nthe system to be re-created if needed. A more detailed discussion of configuration \\nmanagement and change control is presented later in this chapter.\\nBecause of the similarities among the steps, deliverables, and outcomes of new \\ndevelopment and maintenance, you may be wondering how to distinguish between \\nthese two processes. One difference is that maintenance reuses most existing system \\nmodules in producing the new system version. Other distinctions are that a new sys-\\ntem is developed when there is a change in the hardware or software platform or \\nwhen fundamental assumptions and properties of the data, logic, or process models \\nchange.\\nPine Valley Furniture\\nSystem Service Request\\nREQUESTED BY\\nDEPARTMENT\\nLOCATION\\nCONTACT\\nTYPE OF REQUEST\\nPROBLEM STATEMENT\\nJuanita Lopez\\nPurchasing, Manufacturing Support\\nHeadquarters, 1-322\\nTel: 4-3267     FAX: 4-3270     e-mail: jlopez\\nURGENCY\\nDATE November 5, 2017\\n[\\n[\\n[\\n]\\n]\\n]\\n[\\n[\\n[\\n]\\n]\\n]\\nNew System\\nSystem Enhancement\\nSystem Error Correction\\nImmediate—Operations are impaired or \\nopportunity lost\\nProblems exist, but can be worked around\\nBusiness losses can be tolerated until new \\nsystem is installed\\nX\\nX\\nSales growth at PVF has caused greater volume of work for the manufacturing support unit within Purchasing.  \\nFurther, more concentration on customer service has reduced manufacturing lead times, which puts more pressure \\non purchasing activities.

We will describe various types of maintenance, factors influencing the \\ncomplexity and cost of maintenance, and alternatives for managing maintenance. \\nGiven that maintenance activities consume the majority of information-systems-re-\\nlated expenditures, gaining an understanding of these topics will yield numerous \\nbenefits to your career as an information systems professional.\\ntypes of Maintenance\\nYou can perform several types of maintenance on an information system (see \\nTable 14-1). By maintenance, we mean the fixing or enhancing of an informa-\\ntion system. Corrective maintenance refers to changes made to repair defects in \\nthe design, coding, or implementation of the system. For example, if you had \\nrecently purchased a new home, corrective maintenance would involve repairs \\nmade to things that had never worked as designed, such as a faulty electrical out-\\nlet or a misaligned door. Most corrective maintenance problems surface soon \\nafter  installation. When corrective maintenance problems surface, they are typi-\\ncally urgent and need to be resolved to curtail possible interruptions in normal \\nbusiness  activities. Of all types of maintenance, corrective accounts for as much as \\n75 percent of all maintenance activity (Andrews and Leventhal, 1993; Pressman, \\n2005). This is unfortunate because corrective maintenance adds little or no value \\nto the  organization; it simply focuses on removing defects from an existing system \\nwithout adding new functionality (see Figure 14-4).\\nAdaptive maintenance involves making changes to an information system to \\nevolve its functionality to changing business needs or to migrate it to a different \\noperating environment. Within a home, adaptive maintenance might be adding \\nstorm windows to improve the cooling performance of an air conditioner. Adaptive \\nmaintenance is usually less urgent than corrective maintenance because business \\nand technical changes typically occur over some period of time. Contrary to correc-\\ntive maintenance, adaptive maintenance is generally a small part of an organization’s \\nmaintenance effort, but it adds value to the organization.\\nPerfective maintenance involves making enhancements to improve processing \\nperformance or interface usability or to add desired, but not necessarily required, \\nsystem features (“bells and whistles”).

Many systems professionals feel that perfective mainte-\\nnance is not really maintenance but rather new development.\\nPreventive maintenance involves changes made to a system to reduce the \\nchance of future system failure. An example of preventive maintenance might be to \\nincrease the number of records that a system can process far beyond what is currently \\nneeded or to generalize how a system sends report information to a printer so that \\nthe system can easily adapt to changes in printer technology. In our home example, \\npreventive maintenance could be painting the exterior to better protect the home \\nfrom severe weather conditions. As with adaptive maintenance, both perfective and \\npreventive maintenance are typically a much lower priority than corrective mainte-\\nnance. Over the life of a system, corrective maintenance is most likely to occur after \\ninitial system installation or after major system changes. This means that adaptive, \\nperfective, and preventive maintenance activities can lead to corrective maintenance \\nactivities if not carefully designed and implemented.\\nthe Cost of Maintenance\\nInformation systems maintenance costs are a significant expenditure. For some \\n organizations, as much as 60 to 80 percent of their information systems budget \\nis allocated to maintenance activities (Kaplan, 2002). These huge maintenance \\ncosts are due to the fact that many organizations have accumulated more and \\nmore older so-called legacy systems that require more and more maintenance (see \\nFigure 14-5). More maintenance means more maintenance work for program-\\nmers.

In situ -\\nations where a company has not developed its systems in-house but instead has \\nlicensed software, as in the case of ERP systems, maintenance costs remain high. \\nThe standard cost of maintenance for most ERP vendors is 22 percent annually \\n(Nash, 2010). In addition, about one-third of the costs of establishing and keep-\\ning a presence on the Web go to programming maintenance (Legard, 2000). \\nThese high costs associated with maintenance mean that you must understand the \\nfactors influencing the maintainability of systems. Maintainability is the ease with \\nwhich software can be understood, corrected, adapted, and enhanced. Systems \\nwith low maintainability result in uncontrollable maintenance expenses.\\nNumerous factors influence the maintainability of a system. These factors, or \\ncost elements, determine the extent to which a system has high or low maintain-\\nability. Of these factors, three are most significant: the number of latent defects, the \\nnumber of customers, and documentation quality. The others—personnel, tools, \\nand software structure—have noticeable, but less, influence.\\n•\\t Latent defects. This is the number of unknown errors existing in the system after \\nit is installed. Because corrective maintenance accounts for most maintenance \\nactivity, the number of latent defects in a system influences most of the costs as-\\nsociated with maintaining a system.\\n•\\t Number of customers for a given system. In general, the greater the number of cus-\\ntomers, the greater the maintenance costs. For example, if a system has only one \\ncustomer, problem and change requests will come from only one source. Also, \\ntraining, error reporting, and support will be simpler. Maintenance requests are \\nless likely to be contradictory or incompatible.\\n•\\t Quality of system documentation. Without quality documentation, maintenance \\nefforts can increase exponentially. For example, Figure 14-6 shows that the sys-\\ntem maintenance effort takes 400 percent longer with poor-quality documenta-\\ntion. High-quality documentation leads to an 80 percent reduction in the sys-\\ntem maintenance effort when compared with average-quality documentation. In \\nother words, quality documentation makes it easier to find code that needs to be \\nchanged and to understand how the code needs to be changed. Good documen-\\ntation also explains why a system does what it does and why alternatives were not \\nfeasible, which saves wasted maintenance efforts.\\n•\\t Maintenance personnel.

Tools that can automatically produce system documentation where none \\nexists can also lower maintenance costs. Also, tools that can automatically gen-\\nerate new code based on system specification changes can dramatically reduce \\nmaintenance time and costs.\\n•\\t Well-structured programs. Well-designed programs are easier to understand \\nand fix.\\nSince the mid-1990s, many organizations have taken a new approach to manag-\\ning maintenance costs. Rather than develop custom systems internally or through con-\\ntractors, they have chosen to buy packaged application software. Although vendors \\nof packaged software charge an annual maintenance fee for updates, these charges \\nare more predictable and lower than for custom-developed systems (Worthen, 2003). \\nHowever, internal maintenance work may still be necessary when using packages. \\nOne major maintenance task is to make the packaged software compatible with other \\npackages and internally developed systems with which it must cooperate. When new \\nreleases of the purchased packages appear, maintenance may be needed to make all \\nthe packages continue to share and exchange data. Some companies are minimizing \\nthis effort by buying comprehensive packages, such as ERP packages, which provide \\ninformation services for a wide range of organizational functions (from human re-\\nsources to accounting, manufacturing, and sales and marketing). Although the ini-\\ntial costs to install such ERP packages can be significant, they promise great potential \\nfor drastically reducing system maintenance costs.\\nManaging Maintenance\\nAs maintenance activities consume more and more of the systems development bud-\\nget, maintenance management has become increasingly important. Today, far more \\nprogrammers worldwide are working on maintenance than on new development. In \\nother words, maintenance is the largest segment of programming personnel, and \\nthis implies the need for careful management. We will address this concern by dis-\\ncussing several topics related to the effective management of systems maintenance.\\nManaging Maintenance Personnel  One concern with managing maintenance \\nrelates to personnel management. Historically, many organizations had a “mainte-\\nnance group” that was separate from the “development group.” With the increased \\nnumber of maintenance personnel, the development of formal methodologies and \\ntools, changing organizational forms, end-user computing, and the widespread use \\nof very high-level languages for the development of some systems, organizations have \\nrethought the organization of maintenance and development personnel. In other \\nwords, should the maintenance group be separated from the development group? \\nOr should the same people who build the system also maintain it? A third option \\nis to let the primary end users of the system in the functional units of the business \\nhave their own maintenance personnel. The advantages and disadvantages to each of \\nthese organizational structures are summarized in Table 14-2.\\nIn addition to the advantages and disadvantages listed in Table 14-2, there are \\nnumerous other reasons why organizations should be concerned with how they man-\\nage and assign maintenance personnel. One key issue is that many systems profes-\\nsionals don’t want to perform maintenance because they feel that it is more excit-\\ning to build something new than change an existing system (Martin et al., 2008). In \\nother words, maintenance work is often viewed as “cleaning up someone else’s mess.” \\nAlso, organizations have historically provided greater rewards and job opportunities \\nto those performing new development, thus making people shy away from mainte-\\nnance-type careers. As a result, no matter how an organization chooses to manage \\nits maintenance group—separate, combined, or functional—it is now common to '),\n",

This rotation is believed to \\nlessen the negative feelings about maintenance work and to give personnel a greater \\nunderstanding of the difficulties of and relationships between new development and \\nmaintenance.\\nMeasuring Maintenance Effectiveness  A second management issue is the mea-\\nsurement of maintenance effectiveness. As with the effective management of person-\\nnel, the measurement of maintenance activities is fundamental to understanding the \\nquality of the development and maintenance efforts. To measure effectiveness, you \\nmust measure the following factors:\\n•\\t Number of failures\\n•\\t Time between each failure\\n•\\t Type of failure\\nMeasuring the number of and time between failures will provide you with the \\nbasis to calculate a widely used measure of system quality. This metric is referred to as \\nthe mean time between failures (MTBF). As its name implies, the MTBF metric shows \\nthe average length of time between the identification of one system failure and the \\nnext. Over time, you should expect the MTBF value to rapidly increase after a few \\nmonths of use (and corrective maintenance) of the system (see Figure 14-7 for an \\nMean time between failures \\n(MTBF)\\nA measurement of error occurrences that \\ncan be tracked over time to indicate the \\nquality of a system.\\n25\\n20\\n15\\n10\\n5\\nAverage Days Between a Failure\\n0 123456\\nMonths Since System Was Installed\\nFigure 14-7 \\nHow the mean time between failures \\nshould change over time'),\n",

If the MTBF does \\nnot rapidly increase over time, it will be a signal to management that major problems \\nexist within the system that are not being adequately resolved through the mainte-\\nnance process.\\nA more revealing method of measurement is to examine the failures that are \\noccurring. Over time, logging the types of failures will provide a very clear picture of \\nwhere, when, and how failures occur. For example, knowing that a system repeatedly \\nfails to log new account information to the database when a particular customer is \\nusing the system can provide invaluable information to the maintenance personnel. \\nWere the users adequately trained? Is there something unique about this user? Is \\nthere something unique about an installation that is causing the failure? What activi-\\nties were being performed when the system failed?\\nTracking the types of failures also provides important management information \\nfor future projects. For example, if a higher frequency of errors occurs when a partic-\\nular development environment is used, such information can help guide personnel \\nassignments; training courses; or the avoidance of a particular package, language, or \\nenvironment during future development. The primary lesson here is that without \\nmeasuring and tracking maintenance activities, you cannot gain the knowledge to \\nimprove or know how well you are doing relative to the past. To effectively manage \\nand to continuously improve, you must measure and assess performance over time.\\nControlling Maintenance Requests  Another maintenance activity is managing \\nmaintenance requests. There are various types of maintenance requests—some cor -\\nrect minor or severe defects in the systems, whereas others improve or extend system \\nfunctionality. From a management perspective, a key issue is deciding which requests \\nto perform and which to ignore. Because some requests will be more critical than \\nothers, some method of prioritizing requests must be determined.\\nFigure 14-8 shows a flowchart that suggests one possible method you could \\napply for dealing with maintenance change requests. First, you must determine the \\ntype of request. If, for example, the request is an error—that is, a corrective mainte-\\nnance request—then the flowchart shows that the request is placed in the queue of \\ntasks waiting to be performed on the system. For an error of high severity, repairs to \\nremove it must be made as soon as possible. If, however, the error is considered “non-\\nsevere,” then the change request can be categorized and prioritized based upon its \\ntype and relative importance.\\nNot Needed Needed\\nAdaptive/PerfectiveEnhancement\\nOther Corrective\\nChange Request\\nType?\\nType?\\nEvaluate\\nTerminate\\nRequest and\\nNotify Requester\\nSelect Next\\nTask from\\nQueue\\nCategorize/\\nPrioritize\\nFigure 14-8 \\nHow to prioritize maintenance requests'),\n",

Enhancement-type requests must first be evaluated to see \\nwhether they are aligned with future business and information systems’ plans. If not, \\nthe request will be rejected and the requester will be informed. If the enhancement \\nappears to be aligned with business and information systems plans, it can then be \\nprioritized and placed into the queue of future tasks. Part of the prioritization pro\\n-\\ncess includes estimating the scope and feasibility of the change. Techniques used for \\nassessing the scope and feasibility of entire projects should be used when assessing \\nmaintenance requests (see Chapter 5).\\nManaging the queue of pending tasks is an important activity. The queue of \\nmaintenance tasks for a given system is dynamic—growing and shrinking based upon \\nbusiness changes and errors. In fact, some lower-priority change requests may never \\nbe accomplished because only a limited number of changes can be accomplished at \\na given time. In other words, changes in business needs between the time the request \\nwas made and when the task finally rises to the top of the queue may result in the \\nrequest being deemed unnecessary or no longer important given current business \\ndirections. Thus, managing the queue of pending tasks is an important activity.\\nTo better understand the flow of a change request, see Figure \\n14-\\n9. Initially, an \\norganizational group that uses the system will make a request to change the system. \\nThis request flows to the project manager of the system (labeled 1). The project man\\n-\\nager evaluates the request in relation to the existing system and pending changes \\nand forwards the results of this evaluation to the system priority board (labeled 2). \\nThis evaluation will also include a feasibility analysis that includes estimates of proj\\n-\\nect scope, resource requirements, risks, and other relevant factors. The board evalu\\n-\\nates, categorizes, and prioritizes the request in relation to both the strategic and in\\n-\\nformation systems plans of the organization (labeled 3). If the board decides to kill \\nthe request, the project manager informs the requester and explains the rationale \\nfor the decision (labeled 4). If the request is accepted, it is placed in the queue of \\npending tasks. The project manager then assigns tasks to maintenance personnel \\nbased upon their availability and task priority (labeled 5). On a periodic basis, the \\nproject manager prepares a report of all pending tasks in the change request queue. \\nThis report is forwarded to the priority board where they reevaluate the requests in \\nlight of the current business conditions. This process may result in removing some \\nrequests or reprioritizing others.\\nSystem Priority Board\\n1. Change Request\\nProject Manager\\nMaintenance Staﬀ\\nSystem Users\\n2. Change Request\\n3.

It is too difficult to manage a lot of small changes. Further, batch -\\ning changes can reduce maintenance work when several change requests affect \\nthe same or highly related modules. Frequent releases of new system versions may \\nalso confuse users if the appearance of displays, reports, or data entry screens \\nchanges.\\nConfiguration Management A final aspect of managing maintenance is configu-\\nration management, which is the process of ensuring that only authorized changes \\nare made to a system. Once a system has been implemented and installed, the pro-\\ngramming code used to construct the system represents the baseline modules of the \\nsystem. The baseline modules are the software modules for the most recent version \\nof a system whereby each module has passed the organization’s quality assurance \\nprocess and documentation standards. A system librarian controls the checking out \\nand checking in of the baseline source code modules. If maintenance personnel are \\nassigned to make changes to a system, they must first check out a copy of the baseline \\nsystem modules—no one is allowed to directly modify the baseline modules. Only \\nthose modules that have been tested and have gone through a formal check-in pro-\\ncess can reside in the library. Before any code can be checked back in to the librar-\\nian, the code must pass the quality control procedures, testing, and documentation \\nstandards established by the organization.\\nWhen various maintenance personnel working on different maintenance \\ntasks complete each task, the librarian notifies those still working that updates have \\nbeen made to the baseline modules. This means that all tasks being worked on must \\nnow incorporate the latest baseline modules before being approved for check-in. \\nFollowing a formal process of checking modules out and in, a system librarian helps \\nto ensure that only tested and approved modules become part of the baseline system. \\nIt is also the responsibility of the librarian to keep copies of all prior versions of all \\nsystem modules, including the build routines needed to construct any version of the \\nsystem that has ever existed. It may be important to reconstruct old versions of the \\nsystem if new ones fail or to support users that cannot run newer versions on their \\ncomputer system.\\nSpecial software systems have been created to manage system configuration \\nand version control activities (see the box “Configuration Management Tools”). This \\nsoftware is becoming increasingly necessary as the change control process becomes \\never more complicated in organizations deploying several different networks, oper-\\nating systems, languages, and database management systems in which there may be \\nmany concurrent versions of an application, each for a different platform. One func-\\ntion of this software is to control access to modules in the system library. Each time \\na module is checked out or in, this activity is recorded, after being authorized by the \\nConfiguration management\\nThe process of ensuring that only \\nauthorized changes are made to a system.\\nBaseline modules\\nSoftware modules that have been tested, \\ndocumented, and approved to be included \\nin the most recently created version of a \\nsystem.\\nSystem librarian\\nA person responsible for controlling the \\nchecking out and checking in of baseline \\nmodules for a system when a system is \\nbeing developed or maintained.\\nBuild routines\\nGuidelines that list the instructions to \\nconstruct an executable system from the \\nbaseline source code.\\nThere are two general kinds of configuration management tools: \\nrevision control and source code control. With revision control \\ntools, each system module file is “frozen” (unchangeable) to \\na specific version level or is designated as “floating” (change-\\nable), meaning a programmer may check out, lock, and modify \\na specific system module. Only the most recent  version of a \\nmodule—and the specific changes made to it—are stored in the \\nlibrary; all previous versions of a module can be reconstructed, \\nif needed, by applying any changes to the module in reverse \\norder. Source code control tools extend  revision control to not \\nonly a single module, but to any interrelated files to the module \\nbeing changed. Configuration management tools have become \\ninvaluable to the system maintenance process by facilitating \\nthe\\xa0rebuilding of any historic version of a system by recompiling \\nthe proper source code modules. Configuration management \\ntools allow you to trace an executable code module back to its \\noriginal source code version, greatly speeding the identification \\nof programming errors.\\nConfiguration Management Tools'),\n",

This software helps the librarian to track that all necessary steps have been \\nfollowed before a new module is released to production, including all integration \\ntests, documentation updates, and approvals.\\nrole of automated Development tools in Maintenance\\nIn traditional systems development, much of the time is spent on coding and testing. \\nWhen software changes are approved, code is first changed and then tested. Once \\nthe functionality of the code is assured, the documentation and specification docu-\\nments are updated to reflect system changes. Over time, the process of keeping all \\nsystem documentation “current” can be a very boring and time-consuming activity \\nthat is often neglected. This neglect makes future maintenance by the same or differ-\\nent programmers difficult at best.\\nA primary objective of using automated tools for systems development and \\nmaintenance is to radically change the way in which code and documentation are \\nmodified and updated. When using an integrated development environment, ana-\\nlysts maintain design documents such as data flow diagrams and screen designs, \\nnot source code. In other words, design documents are modified and then code \\ngenerators automatically create a new version of the system from these updated \\ndesigns. Also, because the changes are made at the design specification level, most \\ndocumentation changes, such as an updated data flow diagram, will have already \\nbeen completed during the maintenance process itself. Thus, one of the big-\\ngest advantages to using automated tools, for example, is its usefulness in system \\nmaintenance.\\nIn addition to using general automated tools for maintenance, two special-pur-\\npose tools, reverse engineering and reengineering tools, are used to maintain older \\nsystems that have incomplete documentation. These tools are often referred to as \\ndesign recovery tools because their primary benefit is to create high-level design docu-\\nments of a program by reading and analyzing its source code.\\nReverse engineering tools are those that can create a representation of a system \\nor program module at a design level of abstraction. For example, reverse engineer -\\ning tools read program source code as input; perform an analysis; and extract infor -\\nmation such as program control structures, data structures, and data flow. Once a \\nprogram is represented at a design level using both graphical and textual representa-\\ntions, the design can be more effectively restructured to current business needs or \\nprogramming practices by an analyst. For example, Microsoft’s Visual Studio.NET \\ncan be used to reverse engineer applications into UML or other development dia-\\ngrams (see Figure 14-10).\\nSimilarly, reengineering tools extend reverse engineering tools by automatically \\n(or interactively with a systems analyst) altering an existing system in an effort to \\nimprove its quality or performance. As reverse and reengineering capabilities are \\nincluded in more popular development environments, the ability to extend the life \\nand evolve the capabilities of existing systems will be enhanced (Orr, 2005).\\nWebSite MaintenanCe\\nAll of the discussion on maintenance in this chapter applies to any type of informa-\\ntion system, no matter what platform it runs on.

This can be done by inserting a \\n“Temporarily Out of Service” notice on the main page of the section being main-\\ntained and disabling all links within that segment. Alternatively, references to the \\nmain page of the section can be temporarily rerouted to an alternative location \\nwhere the current pages are kept while maintenance is performed to create new \\nversions of those pages. The really tricky part is keeping the site consistent for \\na user during a session; that is, it can be confusing to a user to see two different \\nversions of a page during the same online session. Browser caching functions \\nmay bring up an old version of a page even when that page changes during the \\nsession. One precaution against this confusion is locking, as explained previously. \\nAnother approach is to not lock a page being changed, but to include a date and \\ntime stamp of the most recent change. This gives the page visitor an indication of \\nthe change, which may reduce confusion.\\n•\\t Check for broken links.

She was working on Saturday evening because she \\nwas leaving the next day for a long-overdue, two-week vacation to the Black Hills of \\nSouth Dakota. Before she could leave, however, she wanted to review the appearance \\nand layout of the pages.\\nMidway through the review process, pages from the WebStore began to load \\nvery slowly. Finally, after requesting detailed information on a particular product, the \\nWebStore simply stopped working. The title bar on her Web browser reported the \\nerror:\\nCannot find Server\\nGiven that her plane for Rapid City left in less than 12 hours, Jackie wanted to review \\nthe content and needed to figure out some way to overcome this catastrophic system \\nerror. Her first thought was to walk over to the offices of the information systems de-\\nvelopment group within the same building. When she did, she found no one there. \\nHer next idea was to contact Jim Woo, senior systems analyst and the project man-\\nager for the WebStore system. She placed a call to Jim’s home and found that he was \\nat the grocery store but would be home soon. Jackie left a message for Jim to call her \\nASAP at the office.\\nWithin 30 minutes, Jim returned the call and was on his way into the office to \\nhelp Jackie. Although not a common occurrence, this was not the first time that Jim \\nhad gone into the office to assist users when systems failed during off hours. Before \\nleaving for the office, he connected to the Internet and also found the WebStore to \\nbe unavailable. Because PVF outsourced the hosting of the WebStore to an outside \\nvendor, Jim immediately notified the vendor that the WebStore was down. The ven-\\ndor was a local Internet service provider (ISP) that had a long-term relationship with \\nPVF to provide Internet access, but it had limited experience with hosting commer-\\ncial websites. Jim was informed that a system “glitch” was responsible for the outage \\nand that the WebStore would be online within the next hour or so. Unfortunately, \\nthis was not the first time the WebStore had failed, and Jim felt powerless. More than \\never before, he believed that PVF needed to find a better way to learn about system \\nfailures and, more important, it needed an improved confidence that the system \\nwould operate reliably.'),\n",

Everyone agreed that the \\nWebStore was “critical” to PVF’s future and unanimously agreed that it was “unac-\\nceptable” for the site to be down. One manager summarized the feeling of the group \\nby stating, “I cannot think of a single valid excuse for the system to crash … our \\ncustomers have incredibly high expectations of us … one major mishap could prove \\ndisastrous for PVF.”\\nJim outlined to the group what he felt the next steps needed to be. “I believe \\nthat the root of our problem is with our contract with our Web hosting company. \\nSpecifically, we need to renegotiate our contract, or find a different vendor, so that \\nit includes wording to reflect our expectations of service. Our current agreement \\ndoes not address how emergencies are responded to or what remedies we have for \\ncontinued system failures. The question we must also address is the cost differences \\nbetween having a site that operates 99 percent of the time versus one that operates \\n99.999 percent of the time. I believe,” he continued, “that it could increase our costs \\ntens of thousands of dollars per month to guarantee extremely high levels of system \\nreliability.”\\nAt the conclusion of the meeting, the senior managers unanimously agreed \\nthat Jim should immediately develop a plan for addressing the WebStore’s service \\nlevel problems. To begin this process, Jim prepared a detailed list of specific vendor \\nservices they desired. He felt a very specific list was needed so that the relative costs \\nfor different services and varying levels of service (e.g., response times for system \\nfailures and penalties for noncompliance) could be discussed.\\nWhen asked by a colleague what type of maintenance was being performed on \\nthe WebStore to improve system reliability, Jim had to pause and think. “Well, it is \\nclearly adaptive in that we plan to migrate the system to a more reliable environment. \\nIt is also perfective and preventive. … It is perfective in that we want to make some oper-\\national changes that will improve system performance, and it is also preventive given \\nthat one of our objectives is to reduce the likelihood of system failures.” Through \\nthis discussion it became clear to Jim that the system was much larger than simply \\nthe HTML used to construct the WebStore; it also included the hardware, system \\nsoftware, procedures, and response team in place to deal with unforeseen events. \\nAlthough he had heard it said many times before, Jim now understood that a success-\\nful system reflected all of its various aspects.\\nSummary\\nMaintenance is the final phase in the SDLC. During main-\\ntenance, systems are changed to rectify internal process-\\ning errors or to extend the functionality of the system. \\nMaintenance is where a majority of the financial invest-\\nment in a system occurs and can span more than 20 years. \\nMore and more information systems professionals have \\ndevoted their careers to systems maintenance and, as \\nmore systems move from initial development into opera-\\ntional use, it is likely that even more professionals will in \\nthe future.\\nIt is during maintenance that the SDLC becomes a \\nlife cycle because requests to change a system must first \\nbe approved, planned, analyzed, designed, and then \\nimplemented. In some special cases, when business opera-\\ntions are impaired due to an internal system error, quick \\nfixes can be made. This, of course, circumvents the nor-\\nmal maintenance process. After quick fixes are made, \\nmaintenance personnel must back up and perform a thor-\\nough analysis of the problem to make sure that the correc-\\ntion conforms to normal systems development standards \\nfor design, programming, testing, and documentation. \\nMaintenance requests can be one of four types: corrective, \\nadaptive, perfective, and preventive.\\nHow a system is designed and implemented can \\ngreatly impact the cost of performing maintenance. The \\nnumber of unknown errors in a system when it is installed '),\n",

Most organizations track the frequency, time, \\nand type of each failure and compare performance over \\ntime. Because limited resources preclude organizations \\nfrom performing all maintenance requests, some formal \\nprocess for reviewing requests must be established to make \\nsure that only those requests deemed consistent with orga-\\nnizational and information systems plans are performed. A \\ncentral source, usually a project manager, is used to collect \\nmaintenance requests. When requests are submitted, this \\nperson forwards each request to a committee charged with \\nassessing its merit. Once assessed, the project manager as-\\nsigns higher-priority activities to maintenance personnel.\\nMaintenance personnel must be prevented from \\nmaking unapproved changes to a system. To do this, most \\norganizations assign one member of the maintenance \\nstaff, typically a senior programmer or analyst, to serve as \\nthe system librarian. The librarian controls the checking \\nout and checking in of system modules to ensure that ap-\\npropriate procedures for performing maintenance, such \\nas adequate testing and documentation, are adhered to.\\nAutomated tools are actively employed during main-\\ntenance to enable maintenance to be performed on design \\ndocuments rather than on low-level source code. Reverse \\nengineering and reengineering tools are used to recover \\ndesign specifications of older systems. Once recovered, \\nthese older systems can then be changed at the design \\nlevel rather than the source code level, yielding a signifi-\\ncant improvement in maintenance personnel productivity.\\nWebsite maintenance involves some special atten-\\ntion, including: 24/7/365 operation, checking for broken \\nexternal links, validating code changes before publish-\\ning new or revised pages, reregistration of the website for \\nsearch engines, and avoiding visitor confusion by preview-\\ning future changes.\\nKey TermS\\n14.1 Adaptive maintenance\\n14.2 Baseline modules\\n14.3 Build routines\\n14.4 Configuration management\\n14.5 Corrective maintenance\\n14.6 Maintainability\\n14.7 Maintenance\\n14.8 Mean time between failures \\n(MTBF)\\n14.9 Perfective maintenance\\n14.10 Preventive maintenance\\n14.11 Reengineering\\n14.12 Reverse engineering\\n14.13 System librarian\\nMatch each of the key terms above with the definition that best \\nfits it.\\n____\\xa0 Changes made to a system to fix or enhance its \\nfunctionality.\\n____\\xa0 Changes made to a system to repair flaws in its design, cod-\\ning, or implementation.\\n____\\xa0 Changes made to a system to evolve its functionality to \\nchanging business needs or technologies.\\n____\\xa0 Changes made to a system to add new features or to im-\\nprove performance.\\n____\\xa0 Changes made to a system to avoid possible future problems.\\n____\\xa0 The ease with which software can be understood, cor -\\nrected, adapted, and enhanced.\\n____\\xa0 A measurement of error occurrences that can be tracked \\nover time to indicate the quality of a system.\\n____\\xa0 The process of ensuring that only authorized changes are \\nmade to a system.\\n____\\xa0 Software modules that have been tested, documented, and \\napproved to be included in the most recently created ver -\\nsion of a system.\\n____\\xa0 A person responsible for controlling the checking out and \\nchecking in of baseline modules for a system when a sys-\\ntem is being developed or maintained.\\n____\\xa0 Guidelines that list the instructions to construct an execut-\\nable system from the baseline source code.\\n____\\xa0 Automated tools that read program source code as input \\nand create graphical and textual representations of design-\\nlevel information such as program control structures, data \\nstructures, logical flow, and data flow.\\n____\\xa0 Automated tools that read program source code as input; \\nperform an analysis of the program’s data and logic; and \\nthen automatically, or interactively with a systems analyst, \\nalter an existing system in an effort to improve its quality \\nor performance.'),\n",
